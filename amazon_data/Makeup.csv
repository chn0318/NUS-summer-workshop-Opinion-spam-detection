"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can’t stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long wearing. I go from an 8 hour work day right to the gym and sweat like crazy...and this stuff doesn’t budge! I love it!!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",My lashes are so fair and thin that its hard for me to find mascara that will give me such great volume. This mascara is so good! It was easy and was a flawless result for an affordable price. 100% would reccommend
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I LOVE this mascara!! Read a blog on it and figured why not try it for $5 and to my surprise it’s just as good if not better than the $20 mascara I’ve been using! It’s not waterproof but I can wear it all day at work and then to a super high intensity work out class and it still looks great. As far as some of the reviews saying it’s clumpy, the 2nd ingredient in this is beeswax, if you use body heat to warm up the mascara it will go on super smooth! And now, my one complaint: I posted this picture on social media bragging about this mascara. Off of that single post, in the past week probably about 30 of my people have ordered it. I went to order a tube for my friends mom last night and was shocked to see a $15 price tag!!! TRIPPLED in price from 3 days ago!!! So, FYI to anyone wanting this but not wanting to spend $15, ulta still has it for $4.99"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This has became my favorite mascara. It lasts & doesn't dry super fast so you can build it as much as you want. It comes off easily with my eye makeup remover & doesn't flake throughout the day. I also love the wand (this part is huge for me) it glides the mascara on perfectly & seperates my lashes. I tried the purple tube as well & definitely prefer this one (purple has a curved wand where this one is straight with individual spikes). Also the purple curved wand caused me to get as much mascara on my eyelid as the lashes. But I have been using this stuff since January & have not looked back! For the price & quality you cannot beat it!  Edited for pics: First pic (blue shirt) is with the green tube, the morning after! The other eye pic is with the purple tube, still gets the job done I just love a straight spiky wand. I am not wearing eyelash extensions or falsies. Most of what you see is the magic of the mascara! BUY IT SIS!!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I NEVER write reviews unless I either really love something or hate it. I LOVE THIS MASCARA. I am a mascara fanatic, I buy mascara constantly and always try and find the best one. So, this mascara is super cheap and the best one I've bought so far. In the pictures I posted, I didn't use any eyelash primer or curler and just put two coats on!!! I was so impressed! But it also depends on how long your eyelashes are and if you apply mascara correctly. My eyelashes are not super long naturally but I apply castor oil daily to strengthen them which helps. This mascara doesn't clump (unless you don't know what you're doing) and it has great volume and thickness. You can use one coat to be subtle or you can keep building it up. It also lasts all day. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS, especially since the price is so cheap! It's a steal. Better than all the higher end mascaras I've tried and the drug store ones. I will most definitely be buying another one when my current one runs out."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",I bought this mascara after reading an article on Facebook about it. It does work wonders!! I personally think it’s as good if not better than my Younique fiber lashes and it doesn’t flake off like that does! I used 2-3 coats and my lashes look amazing. Just like falsies. Great product
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",I would give this ZERO stars if I could! It runs after about 30 minutes of wear giving me raccoon eyes. No use in using a mascara that does that. I will never waste my money on this awful product again! $4.99 is cheap but even that is too much for a terrible product! I’m on an Amazon shopping group and most of the people in the group who purchased this also complained about it smearing and giving dark circles under the eyes so it’s not just one person. The pic I attached shows it after only 30 min of wear. The longer I wear it the worse it looks!!
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","When I received my mascara it was in an unissued box with a sticker over the seal to show it was new, I'm not actually sure if it was a new bottle. I used it a handful of times, but didn't like it much. It clumped my lashes together, making them look messy and the mascara flakes like crazy!! At night when I go to take it off, it takes FOREVER and even when you think you got it all, you didn't. I don't wear much for makeup and I don't wear it everyday. It had been weeks since I wore any makeup on my face, then 2 days in a row I wore this mascara. Day 1 my left eye was so irritated and by day 2 I had a stye on my bottom lash line that is incredibly painful. I have never had a stye before and I have to chalk it up to it being from this mascara. Not being able to fully clean it off, the flakes, and the fact that I can't say it wasn't used makes me believe my stye is a result of this mascara."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","After seeing some impressive before-and-after photo reviews of this product, I decided to try it out. Weighing the pros and cons, it's a good mascara- great even, considering the price point. Some cons include that this product goes on very wet and thick. When applying, I make sure to tilt my head back and look down at my mirror so that there is a smaller chance of my eyelashes brushing against my upper lids. I hold this position for about 30 seconds to let it dry a little before moving on to the next eye, otherwise it will smear all over the lid. I have long lashes, so perhaps not everyone will face this issue. You can build up a good deal of product in one round of application, rather than going back to reapply after it dries. It is a tad bit clumpy, but it isn't a ""spider legs"" look by any means . It looks nice with a little practice mastering an application technique. I will mention that I did not like this mascara at all the first day I tried it, it was far too wet and I felt it just clumped everything together. However, I'm sure others have noticed how a day one mascara applies is generally not a true test to it's intended effect.  I would encourage anyone to give it a shot for this price, you'll most likely either love it or you'll think it's acceptable at best . I would most likely buy this again; although I admit this was a bit of a novelty purchase, I am impressed."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性", I was about to give up on cheap mascara. I have tried all of them and a chunk of the expensive brands too like Two Faced and Tarte. Let me tell you what though! This is the best! Every lash is fanned out and lengthen. Doesn’t make them clump or spidery. I’m obsessed and for the price it’s 1000000x worth it. I’m sold for life
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This mascara was wonderful in the beginning, it does everything it claims: lengthens lashes, goes on smoothly, stays all day. But after about a week of wearing, my eyes became irritated and scratchy. I thought maybe they’d get used to it, so I continued wearing it. That is until I ended up with an itchy rash below one of my eyes one morning. I’ve had to stop wearing this completely. For some reason my eyes and skin have a reaction to it, and I’ve never had an issue wearing any other cosmetics before. Major bummer, as I ordered 3 of these, hoping to love it."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I decided to try an inexpensive mascara, since we wash it off every night. I LOVE this mascara 😻 !!!! I took a photo of one eye with this mascara (blue arrow eye) and the other with a $32 mascara (Charlotte Tilbury). My husband could not tell the difference and I think this mascara (marked with blue arrow) looks better and the lashes are longer. FYI-I have a bald spot of lashes gone from using Charlotte Tilbury's mascara (the eye with the arrow) and still this eye looks better with Lash Princess. I have not had any lashes lost from Lash Princess Effect Mascara. GREAT 👍 mascara!!!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Play Video  Everybody likes fake eyelashes but I actually hate them. I hate playing with the glue, I hate having to clean the glue off of your lashes and I hate when you lose lashes using falsies. I am a customer of thrive mascara which is about $30 or $25 something like that.  This mascara is going to be my new mascara it is perfectly buildable and you can “water it down“ using contact solution, just a little though, This mascara I feel makes my face look very pretty"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性"," This mascara is worth the hype! To get this is effect on my short lashes that pretty much grow straight forward, it usually takes 3-4 coats. This did it in 2, didn't crumble, lifted, separated and thickened my lashes without clumping and has finally made me want to give up lash extensions. For the price and results, this can't be beat!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",I wanted to love this mascara but it just wasn’t great. It really did give my lashes volume and length but they got clumpy and stuck together all the time. It was hard to remove with soap and water (I don’t use makeup remover so that may be why I struggled but my go to mascara rinses very easily without it) and it usually had smudged quite a bit by the end of the day. The worst part was the reaction I had to it. My eyes would get really puffy and start to hurt and then get really bloodshot. Nothing worked to get the irritation to calm down not even clear eyes drops and ice packs. It took a couple days for my eyes to return to normal and stop hurting. I used it multiple times and every time I had this reaction. I don’t feel like my eyes are overly sensitive but something about this product just did not agree with me.
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Lash Princess is by far the best mascara I have ever used. I went from spending $100 a year to $15 on mascara!! My lashes look so beautiful, it’s the only make up I wear daily. It gives me fabulous volume control, I have been asked several times if I have lash extensions.  Also, it’s very easy to remove, comes right off with my regular face wash. No special eye makeup remover needed.  A couple of tips:  How to prevent raccoon eyes: There is A LOT of product inside, so make sure you scrape off as much off your brush before applying it to your lashes.  Also, unless you purchase the waterproof version of this mascara DON’T put it on your bottom lashes. It makes your lashes so long, it will scrape agains your skin causing it to smudge."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Love this mascara! I’ve used the “best of the best” designer, super hyped, ultra popular mascara available and NOTHING compares to this stuff! I don’t even bother using a lash curler anymore! I buy 2 at a time so I always have a spare (yes, it’s that good!!). I highly recommend this particular mascara... it goes on effortlessly, it lasts pretty much all day, and the price?- I feel like I’m almost stealing it! I’d give it a 10 star if I could!!!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I've had this mascara in my cart for the longest time. Finally decided to try it out and I AM IMPRESSED!!! Super lengthening and volumizing! I've tried about 80% of drugstore mascara and would only repurchase one kind. This exceeds that one kind, by far! New favorite for sure! It does transfer to under my eyebrow by the end of the day, which is not something I've had with any other mascaras I've used. That's my only negative. This mascara is not for no-makeup-makeup days lol it's so extra and I love it!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I never question my $30 purchase for high end mascaras (Diorshow and Stila are two of my favorite pricey ones) but after using this... I'm not sure ill ever splurge on mascara again. It works just as good if not better! Not clumpy, and doesn't leave lashes hard or stiff! Don't mind my not made up face in pictures but left is with mascara and right is without (also my lashes aren't curled, can't imagine how great they'd look if they were)"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性", Not always sure how accurate the reviews are but for the price I decided to give it a try. I love it. It does just as good if not better than some of my higher priced mascaras at giving me volume and length. I would definitely purchase again.
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I bought this mascara because it had been highly hyped by a few different fashion bloggers. Sadly, I did not experience the same love affair as them. I hate the packaging. It is literally just a tube, no wrapper, no seal, no cardboard. This worries me because how can you tell if it has been tampered with or used??? I would gladly pay $1 or $2 to know I’m not risking pink eye for long lashes. That alone makes me want to keep looking for another mascara, but so far I’ve been pink eye free after using 1.5 weeks! I like that it is a brush applicator as I seem to have horrible luck with the silicone bristle brushes. It is a tapered brush which helps you really get into the edges and the smaller lashes. Unfortunately, almost too much comes out on the brush and it’s hard to get off and I’ve ended up with clumpy lashes that I’ve had to redo. I would probably use a different mascara if I were applying in a rush or in a car or somewhere I would be unprepared to possibly have to redo my lashes. Maybe it will be better after the tube has dried a bit. It does tend to rub off below my bottom lashes leaving me with darker circles than I already have :( (co-sleeping 2.5 year old) My photo is after I’ve had the mascara on for 6hrs or so, running errands, so you can kind of see some of the under eye darkness. Sadly, I will keep looking for my perfect mascara"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",I was excited to try this because I saw it on a blog review. I don’t know who they paid off.... so it started out looking nice had good build up looked nice and thickened my lashes..... 4 hours later it looked like I had gone swimming and rubbed my eyes. Seriously so bad. I’m just glad I was our with friends and not at an event so they could tell me I need to go fix my mascara. Save your money and pay a little more this is the worst mascara I’ve boight.
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","My review has some layers to it. I promise there’s a point.  First I was “targeted” on social media to buy this new mascara. It was only $5 and the reviews were all really positive and I thought, why not? So I bought it.  I’m a teacher and since the pandemic hit, I no longer wear makeup to school. Makeup irritates my skin with my mask so I just haven’t been wearing anything plus it makes morning time hella easy #bareface  This mascara delivered in the evening, so I decided to try it out the next day and wore it to school. I only put on the mascara, literally no other makeup on my face. Just my lashes were done with this $5 magic.  I kid you not - my lashes were literally ALL I heard about that day. Upon walking in the building, a teacher friend from all the way at the other end of the hall and was like “oh she got makeup on today!!!!” Each kid that came up to me commented on the lashes. One kid even told me I looked younger and the best story of all …. A teammate of mine was out and the sub was having trouble with the announcements and so I went in to help her. Her homeroom just went bananas about my lashes and then they started clapping and I got a standing ovation. A literal standing ovation.  Best $5 I’ve ever spent LOL"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性"," Awesome quality mascara. Easy to apply and dries quickly without smudging. Has super volume, just like I was wearing natural looking false lashes. Easy to take off with makeup cleaner or soap and water and lets all day with no clumping. Great price too! Highly Recommend!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","**11-1-21- Okay so update on my original review. I DO like this mascara. First, it has not dried out and turned into a clumpy-cakey mess, it's still the same consistency as when I bought it. It does go on easier now that I've been using it a bit also. So I would most likely buy this again.**  Ill start off by saying I did give this 5 stars but I'm not sure if I truly like it or not and keep flip flopping back and forth on that.. for me personally, my eyelashes are a pain the _$$ they're individually very fine and medium to long in length and nearly impossible to apply mascara to without getting it everywhere and using an eyelash comb or pin to get them in line, otherwise they look stupid.. once applied properly my eyelashes can look great, if the mascara isn't a dry clumpy mess. So with that said, while everyone says it doesn't clump, for me, it does and even worse it glops on. I've had to resort to using a lash comb daily which is the part I dislike about this mascara. What I DO like is its very buildable and I can manually direct my lashes in the direction I want them to go AND this mascara doesnt dry like a hard flaky mess. I haven't had any dry crumbs under my eyes after wearing this mascara all day and at the end of the day, it's still on and feels soft to the touch. Not sure why a couple people said it gives raccoon eyes, for me it does not do that and I overheat and sweat a lot so if it was going to do that, I would've definitely seen that by now, I've been using it about a week. All in all, it's definitely a good value and in my opinion way better than Maybelline falsies which crumbs, flakes and the tube dries out in a week. I think I like it a lot better than what I've been using and pretty sure it would be amazing on someone with normal eyelashes, unlike my thin, fine pains in the butt."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have long eyelashes that are so light that you can’t see them when I don’t have mascara on. I am extremely picky about mascara and I’ve tried almost every expensive brand and store brand available. Even ones that get good reviews, I usually do not like because they clump, or I look like a raccoon, or it flakes off. I do not use waterproof mascara because I like to be able to wash my face and remove my mascara in one step rather than having to use make up remover as a separate step. Hands-down this is the best mascara I have ever used. And it’s only $4.99. Unbelievable! I used it for the first time yesterday and it never flaked, it didn’t clump what I put it on, and no raccoon eyes. The first picture shows my left eye without any mascara and my right eye with this mascara only on the top lashes. The second picture is with only one coat of this mascara on all my lashes. I do not use false lashes or lash inserts. Highly recommend this mascara."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I was looking forward to trying this product, as the reviews were so positive. However, upon receiving the mascara, the wand was hard to remove from the cylinder and when it did come out it was extremely damaged. I would love a replacement tube so that I can provide a more positive review."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",This mascara was recommended on a Facebook group. It isn't my normal brand. I had to wash my face clean at work because my eyes burned so bad. I can't return it it says no returns. If you have sensitive eyes I would be careful!
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have found my holy grail mascara! Most days, I dont wear any makeup, except for mascara - this is perfect for that or a more dramatic look. In the first photo you can see that I have barely visable blonde eyelashes, and the difference one coat applied to the other eye. The second photo is both eyes with one coat and the third photo is both with two coats. This mascara provides length and volume with a good wand to separate lashes. It dries to a soft, feathery texture. This stuff stays put! It has stood the test of rubbing, itchy/watering eyes from allergy symptoms, crying, running through rain, sleeping in make up - all without smudging, flaking or clumping. This version doesn't claim to be water proof, though water and my regular cleanser are not enough, I have to use eye makeup remover to clean it off thoroughly."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I normally don’t like to submit a photo for a review but I had to. My fiancé thought I put on fake eyelashes. I normally have long eyelashes but the ends are blonde so you can’t tell unless I am wearing mascara. I definitely will be recommending this to friends, so economical for how great it is. Better then most department store mascaras. This is only one coat by the way."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Okay, so I saw this on a list of those like ""22 things on Amazon I love/would buy again/whatever"" lists, and I had been looking for a less expensive alternative to my current mascaras (I use Tarte Amazon Clay and Perversion by Urban Decay. Each costs upwards of $25), and I thought, for $5, why not give it a shot. SO GLAD I DID! The issues I have with both of my regular mascaras are that the Urban Decay smudges way too easily, and the Tarte flakes way too easily - thus, I have been using one coat each. So $50 or more I am spending on mascara alone every time I buy makeup. I had reached a point of ridiculousness. This mascara gives great volume with one coat, and I wear it for 12 hour night shifts without it smudging or flaking off. I will say that it does tend to clump, so you have to be careful with application, but the upside of that is the volume it gives your lashes. It is a definitely a more spidery appearance than deep and lush like you get with Perversion, but since Perversion comes off and smudges so easily, I'm really only going to use it for special occasions from now on, because it's not worth it to have my mascara all up under my eyes after 3 hours. I think also that may be the application brush it comes with, and if you used a fluffier mascara brush you would get that feathery look from it. All in all, an excellent buy. For $5! I rarely use drug store brand anything and NEVER buy makeup from Amazon, but I'm glad I took a shot on this."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","So Amazon suggested I might like this and I read the reviews and decided to try. I accidentally ordered two, but now I’m glad I did, because I really like this mascara and will even buy again. What I like about it is that it makes my eyelashes look long and separated, instead of long and heavy and clumpy like some mascaras. This feels light on my lashes, not heavy, if that makes sense. I think it stays on ok but I can’t really say because I always follow with waterproof maybelline mascara in the pink tube. That mascara is really water proof but doesn’t do much for length or thickness. I only use it for my final layer.  I have to say my eyelashes look super good lately. They are looking really long and the only thing I can think is it must be because I have started using Albolene moisturizing cleanser to remove my eye makeup. I used to use coconut oil. The albolene works fine to remove this mascara and the rest of my make up and then I just use a hot wash cloth to remove the excess. It must leave some moisture in my lashes because I’ve been surprised how nice my eyelashes are doing and I’m 72 years old. So I would recommend trying both this mascara and the albolene cleanser which I also bought on Amazon."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I've been wearing makeup for 35 years, so I have worn my share of different mascaras. Dollar store, drug store, high end, you name it, it's been on my face. This little unassuming sucker is a GAME. CHANGER. She is now my Holy Grail. I scrape the whole brush, sometimes even lightly blot it, because I don't like a lot of product right out of the gate.. A little wiggle and a swish, and I legit have eyelashes that look like they've been glued on. They're feathery and defined and full, super dark, no flakes, no smudges, no traveling under your eyes making you look like a drunk stripper...(not that there's anything wrong with that.) I add one more light coat to the tips of my lashes and voila, I'm a doe-eyed princess. The trick is to CURL YOUR LASHES first. That goes for any mascara, because it makes a massive difference. Blast your curler with your blow-dryer for a second if you're feeling super fancy. Don't sleep on this, Queens! For the results I get with this mascara, I would happily pay triple the price, but the gag is, you don't have to! Scrape your change together and buy this!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have been buying this product for a while now but I recently deviated and tried the Skyhigh Mascara that's gone viral so now I'm comparing it. The SkyHigh Mascara, besides being several times the price, was may be as lengthening on a good day and even the regular kind - not the waterproof kind - was ridiculously hard to get off, yet somehow it STILL seemed to flake off under my eyes during the day. O.o  This mascara, besides being a literal fraction of the price is quite easy to remove but does seem to flake off over the course of the day as much as the more expensive brand. It's also at least if not more lengthening. It's every bit worth the hype. I was just at Ulta with a girlfriend who was looking for mascara. The girl was ready to spend $40 on some Dior mascara and was skeptical of the low price. I told her to hold onto her butt and, because it's so cheap, I just bought her some and had it shipped to her house. She's hooked now, too. This stuff is awesome. 10/10"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Makeup is expensive. So is paying for lash extensions. Where is the happy medium you ask? Well friends it's this little tube of magic my sister introduced me to after uncovering on Woot! I've always had lashes that look amazing with the flick of a wrist accompanied by a magic wand of expensive mascara (usually mastered with two brands - Too Faced ""Better Than Sex"" Mascara & Benefits ""Their Real"" combo. At a whopping $50 a month for two amazing mascaras I realized I could get extensions for that price. Anyhow, I can't imagine $4 a month being better spent elsewhere? Try it out. Those mascara pros know you first swoop it over lashes vertical then horizontal to give it the lift and volume and only need 3 swoops with this ONE brand. Try it out. You legit can't see my eyelashes without mascara and less than a minute later I look woke :)"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have been a mascara snob my entire adult life, and have been purchasing the same two brands for mascara. Then, I decided to get an inexpensive tube of mascara just to have in my emergency makeup back, and WOW was I surprised!  One coat of this stuff is better than 4 or 5 coats of my other stuff. It isn't waterproof, so it comes off with just a makeup-removing facial cleanser or micellar water with no problem. It separates and lengthens my lashes. I have people stop and ask me ALL THE TIME what I do to my eyelashes to make them ""look like that."" Like... literally stopped in the middle of a sidewalk in downtown Tampa to ask about my eyelashes.  And it really does stay in place, even without a setting spray, when most of the other makeup I use melts off. Seriously Let me put this in perspective: I live in Florida, and I wore this mascara to work every single day for the last year in the heat/humidity (including all through the summer) and they stayed on my lashes better than any other brand of mascara I've used.  This is now officially turned into my go-to mascara!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This mascara looks great after applying thusly: Apply twice to top lashes, dipping wand between applications Apply once to bottom lashes without reloading wand. Repeat for other eye. If the contents seem to be dry and mascara does does glide on with ease don't use water to dilute the makeup. A drop of mineral oil into the tube and then stir it with the wand. Do not try to mix using a pumping action as this will push air into the tube and make the contents even drier.  I do wake up with racoon eyes if I don't remove it before going to bed but I haven't experienced this during waking hours. Unlike most eyebrow pencils (grr!) I don't have to reapply my mascara, even through long hours - daytime and throughout the night - as we sometimes get down here in Las Vegas.  If anyone is having trouble with racoon eyes and/or the mascara becoming crummy (not crummy-bad; I mean the crumbs type of crummy) the mineral oil trick ought to help with that."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Lash Princess will now be my go-to mascara! It's easy to apply and makes my lashes look great (I'm 73 years old). I will use a brush afterward and reapply if I want more of a dramatic effect. There is no caking! During the day, there are no problems with flaking. I've had problems with flaking and it's hard to find a mascara that doesn't flake. This mascara has not been harsh on my lashes and I use Ivory soap, or another gentle cleaner, to remove the mascara without any problem. I definitely recommend this product for young and old!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",I have probably tried every mascara on the market and this blows them all out of the park. Let me start by saying that I wear contact lenses so it’s important that nothing flake off into my eyes during the day from my mascara and after wearing this mascara countless times I have never had an issue with this. TheMascara Goes on easily it builds it thickens it separates. It makes you look like you’re wearing false eyelashes. I can honestly say that I can go out with just mascara and blush and feel like I made up without having to put on eyeliner and eyeshadow. It doesn’t flake into your eyes even if you accidentally rub your eyes and it’s easily removed with either make up remover or soap and water or the make up eraser pads. I sincerely hope they stay in business because I will be a fan for life and there’s not many things I can say that about.
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I ALMOST didn't buy this mascara because of some of the negative reviews. I am so glad I didn't listen. I was expecting a mess when I went to apply this (per negative reviews) but no. It went on just as smoothly and easily as any other mascara I've used. I've used Mabelline colossal forever. I've tried thrive, younique, you name it. This just became my ultimate favorite mascara! I was liking Thrive but I've noticed it doesn't do well for everyday use. I can only use it every other day. It just doesn't give a consistent result so I went looking for something other than my go-to Mabelline. I've just found it!! This separates my lashes, glides on, no smudge, great lengthener & volume. Not to be salty but some people just never really learned how to put on mascara correctly. That could be one issue for some as this is a wet mascara. The brush holds plenty of product. If you're one of the strange birds that tries to apply mascara while driving, (please stop) and this mascara is not for you. If you are someone who likes to apply mascara in a rush and only want to dedicate 3 seconds to applying....this mascara is not for you. If you don't want dramatically longer looking lashes this is not for you. Other things I love: the brush, the tube has rubber on it to keep it from slipping out of your fingers and when you close the tube up, it actually ""clicks"" closed. For the price????? This is a STEAL! Don't listen to the negative reviews! Just buy it!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have read that this mascara is wonderful so I wanted to give it a try. I have very very short eye lashes so I have tried so many mascaras overt the years that I have lost count. Boy I was very surprised to find out that this is one of the best for volume ,it went on so well very easy to use and the value you do get a lot for your money. I had to put 3 coats on but it looks really nice with the volume and it looked like I have false eyelashes on. The color I chose was the dark black and it’s very dark and rich just what I wanted with no smudges or raccoon eyes, I found it very easy to apply and add more coats without any hesitation. I highly recommend this you will be very satisfied!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I’m used to layering my mascara so that I have volume but not a think or clumpy look. It’s not “bad” per se, but it’s not the usual look for me. The price can’t be beat, that’s for sure!  I don’t dislike this mascara and even though I have some of my usual brand, I’m still using it, and not just to “use it up” since it will probably take a little while to do that.  It’s not easy to remove, and I have had some lashes break if I forget I’m wearing it in the evening and rub my eyes. Fortunately I don’t do that often. The upside of it not being easy to remove is that it stays on, and doesn’t smudge or run easily at all. And while it’s not waterproof, it almost is, but isn’t as difficult to remove as a waterproof mascara can be.  I use makeup remover wipes and then my regular face wash and as long as I pay extra attention to removing the mascara with the face wipes, it’s fine.  Will I purchase again? Maybe? I don’t know? It’s not that much less expensive than my regular mascara, but it is very different. I think it’s just less “my style” but still pretty good stuff!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Mascara is the one makeup product that I HAVE to have. You know, if I was on a deserted island and could have only one makeup product what would it be... it's mascara. I have bought so many different brands of mascara over the years and to-date, essence Lash Princess is my favorite. And for the price, it cannot be beaten.  It comes in two types, but I've only tried the False Lash Effects. This mascara lasts all day, doesn't smudge and I've never had it clump up on me. For everyday use this is my go-to mascara and so thankful I found it. I will be a repeat customer for sure.  The only con is that it comes unsealed. It had a sticker across one side showing it was new, but no packaging or plastic wrap/shrink wrapping. I think this is another way they keep the cost so low, though... maybe. I still love this mascara."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I am a long time fan of cliniqe's lash power mascara. It has to technology that wraps each individual lash and volume and length without smudging or flaking all day. It comes off easily with water. I was extremely skeptical when someone told me about the essence princess last mascara and said that it had the same performance and durability as my favorite. I tried it and I am pleased to say it really is very similar in performance. However, it is not Tube Technology so it is not as easy to get off. I do find it comes off with oily eye makeup remover like garnier's waterproof mascara micellar water. That being said oh, the only complaint I would have about the princess lash mascara it's a tube is very bulky it's not portable like the Lash power. But for the 499 price tag I'll relinquish the extra room in my makeup bag. I wish the wand were a bit thinner like the last power bulky mascara wands 10 to make a mess all over my monolid. Actually I have more of a micro LED since I am Japanese Korean and Irish mixed. That smaller lid space collects more mascara goo. I don't find this mascara messy it applies beautifully in just one or 2 swipes. I love it! In fact, I love it so much that I purchased two extras and handed them out in a women's community that I started on Facebook."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This stuff is appropriately hyped. I’m not any kind of a makeup guru (my makeup routine generally consists of “throw on some black eyeliner and mascara” because that’s a low maintenance look that makes my eyes pop) and I don’t want to actually spend money on makeup. This is by far the BEAT cheap mascara I’ve ever used. Normally I just grab some Maybeline or Covergirl when I’m in CVS (I don’t usually pay attention to which one because honestly they’re kind of all the same), but I ran out so added this to my Amazon order. I was SO surprised that it was noticeably different than the “drug store staples.”  I’ve got long-ish lashes to begin with (lucky me!) and this makes them look so long other girls think I’m wearing falsies. Definitely recommend.  Bonus tip: I don’t bother with an eyelash curler, but you can get a similar effect with this if you put on the mascara, and then press your finger against the bottom of your lashes like you’re trying to curl them up (while the mascara is still wet) and hold it there for 20 seconds. Then shabam- you’ve got some lashes that REALLY pop. (Although you’ll end up with mascara streaks all over your finger but it’s easy to rinse off)"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","There is one makeup item I will sink a fortune into! Mascara! I am getting older and as most older worn do I am losing my eyelashes. I use a good eye lash serum and now I will be using this mascara! I have paid 39.00 for mascara and yet this 5.00 dollar one beats it hands down. It had a brush I love...long and slender so I could get every last hair....and is just hands down amazing. I looked as if I had false lashes on. My husband told me dive times that day I looked beautiful. I am thinking the mascara. It opens your eyes and separates, darkens and adds length and fullness in two coats! I apply one and let it dry them apply another. Best mascara I have ever used in my life and I have used them all! And under five dollars....yes there is a God! Lol"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have small, deep-set eyes and have trouble keeping mascara in place. To top it off, my lashes are with light brown/blonde. Not ideal! The only mascara I’ve been able to keep on my lashes (instead of under my eyes) is a tubing mascara that cost $30. I tried this mascara out of curiosity and was amazed at how well it performed (the price point is incredible and the reviews persuading). This mascara gave my lashes more volume than the tubing mascara I use and stayed in place the entire day. There’s a little color fading after about 8 hours, but that is roughly 7 hours longer than my tubing mascara starts to fade. I didn’t have any color transfer onto my skin at all (so nice not to look like I have dark circles under my eyes). The easiest way for me to apply the mascara is to hold the brush near the lash line of my upper lashes and blink slowly. The color goes on for me without any clumping. I do both upper lashes and then use the mascara that’s left on the brush to darken my lower lashes. I will be buying this mascara regularly!!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This mascara is just great!! The red arrow is Lash Princess and the other eye is my regular mascara MadLash by the Balm which ive used for years!! My lashes arent curled here and both eyes have 2 coats on. I am VERY surprised/happy with the Lash Princess!! Works just as great as my more expensive mascara aaannd its WAY cheaper!! I'm hair that it holds my lashes up without curling. The brush is a regular one so just be careful with clumping, a lash comb would be ideal.  This formula is a bit thicker than my other one so careful with clumping BUT it does a great job. May help to oil/hydrate your lashes the night before for a smoother application. I still like the brush on my other one so I may swap but the applicator does the job. You could definitely apply to add length if you wanted. My lashes are already long but this helps keeping them up without curling first, a problem I've had with other mascaras. Comes off easily with water!  Overall would highly recommend."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I read the reviews, I saw the price, I thought ""What have I got to lose?"" I went ahead and ordered. I'm so glad I did. I would seriously rate this as one of the best mascaras I have ever used. I get pretty obsessed with trying new mascaras. Lets face it here are so many coming out all the time. I'm just trying to find one that can make my short, stubby lashes look decent. Other requirements are that they do not make me look like a racoon after a drunken night on the town, or flake over my lower lids, cheeks or anywhere for that matter. This one meets all of the requirements. Most days I only need one coat of this black magic in a bottle! It can do in one coat, what others take 2 or 3 coats to achieve. It's smooth, not clumpy. It doesn't sting my eyes. It gives my lashes length and definition. It stays put all day, until I take off my make up. It comes off easily, with no extra rubbing or tugging. For the price, this can't be beat. I'll use this over much pricier options any day of the week."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I can’t believe this mascara for the price point. I’ve used drugstore mascara for years, with meh results, then discovered higher-end and designer mascaras, some with not-bad results, some making me feel bougie and ridiculous for spending $30 on mascara. This Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara is a measly $5.00. And that’s the regular price. During last week’s Prime Days, this mascara was selling for $3.00, so I bought a couple more. I love how the tube is shrink-wrapped for sanitary purposes. And I love that it’s cruelty-free.  The brush is decent; it actually dispenses a good amount of product while separating lashes and avoiding clumps. The building aspect is phenomenal. It doesn’t dry so quickly that you have to work on building one set of lashes, keep building those lashes, then start the other eye. Actually, with this mascara, it’s ideal to apply the mascara to one eye, then the other, then the 1st eye, then the other again.  I’ve got the stereotypical fine, sparse, and short Asian eyelashes (worse now that I’m aging), but this Essence formula is so perfect, dark, creamy, and so effective that I can get away with only 2-3 layers on my top eyelashes, and I’m done.  It’s not waterproof, so carry your handkerchief with you, but nor will it rain black tears down your face either. (I’ve teared up without ill effect.) For being water-based, it’s kind of tough to remove, but I just use waterproof micellar water.  Love this mascara. I’m a customer for life. Now I get to break the bank on other things (jk). Hope this review helps. Especially recommended from someone with really crappy natural lashes."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I was skeptical when I ordered this...I saw this advertised by a Dani Austin (she's a famous blogger). I decided hey..it's $5! I have tried EVERY mascara out there. I hadn't tried this one. It won me over on the first swipe! The wand works great for little to no eyelashes...it gave me more volume than I got with expensive ""Better than Sex"" Mascara! The kicker is..it doesn't smudge off! And it's NOT waterproof! I hate mascara that ends up under my eyes at the end of the day...this is not that. It stays where you put it until you take it off. I was thrilled with this product and will purchase again! TRY IT!!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","According to Amazon, I have ordered this six times (and I now have a subscription for it), so I decided it was time for a review. I try different mascaras all the time as I feel my eyes are my best feature, and I want to highlight them. I was amazed that a mascara this good came at such an inexpensive price. I no longer use an eyelash curler as this mascara gives my lashes plenty of curl and lift. It coats the lashes very well, too. It occasionally clumps, but the lashes are easily separated by hand. I have not had any smudging or flaking like I had with other mascaras. It removes easily - I use Cetaphil or Neurogena face wipes. I think my lashes are healthier, too, now that I’m not using an eyelash curler. I also use a new mascara every three months to avoid infection. I can’t praise Essence Princess enough. Try it! I think you’ll be delighted you did."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","It doesn't work as dramatically as the viral photo online shows, but it does add some serious length to your eyelashes. Better than any mascara I have ever used, and I have them all. And I do mean all of them. If Sephora ever carried it, I bought it. This mascara is nothing short of amazing. I have red hair and my eyelashes are short and very light. And when I say light, I mean practically transparent. Without mascara, it looks like I don't have eyelashes at all. I put this on and my lashes looked amazing. Not just visible, but they had some serious length. Forget all the other brands, I'm using this from now on. And the price? It's a sweet sweet deal!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Very nice mascara for the price. (Straight wand) Like a lot of the other reviews, I am a mascara snob...not just anything will do and usually prefer the more pricier brands when it comes to my mascara. But I have to say, I really like this mascara. Applied well and I could tell with just one coat that I was going to like it and if course, I wasn't stopping at 1 coat.😉 as I applied more the volume was nice and didn't get clumpy. Gave a little length for me. I'm sure if you have longer lashes but looking for volume, this will work for you. At minimum I would try it with an open mind - make your own decision. Oh and love the design of the container. Very girlie 🥰 Update: I have been using this mascara for several days now and I still love it. I dont have any issues with smudging. I started using my lash primer that I have and it took it to a whole other level. But even without primer it's a great mascara."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I finally tried the Essence Lash Princess mascara this morning. I did not use a lash curler but did have a lash lift or 'lash perm' as it's also known but this was many weeks ago. My lashes do not naturally curl upward at all. They have some decent length and I have been using LiLash to assist in growing them back after lash extensions depleted them. With no effort this mascara lifts and coats lashes very nicely. Some of my lashes tend to go in funky directions so that was the only downside....whichever way your lashes want to lay the Essence will majorly enhance that. There weren't any clumps which is nice and the formula feels very rich. I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts and so far, no irritation and once it's dry no smudges coming off. I will see how it holds up through the day and over the next week or so. I might also try using a lash curler first since paying for lash lifts is spendy and I believe this mascara mimics a lash lift by itself!! If anything changes I'll update this post, but for now I completely see why this is the number one mascara on amazon and especially for the price! I've used expensive mascaras and if you switched the labels on me I would assume this was the pricey one."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have thin shorter lashes and have tried every mascara from high-end products down to cheaper ones. Everyone of them said water and sweat proof, and non smuggling but it did all three.. I even tried false lashes and they never looked nice.I was dissatisfied with them all until this mascara I love it. Does everything it says it does. My eyelashes looked naturally full and long. I built it up by putting it like 2 to 3 times and I received many compliments. Even in line at the grocery checkout I received compliment from the cashier. It even made my eyes look beautiful. I will never go back to use any other one out on the market. This is my one and only. I even love how the tube is cute and the design of rubber on it. I'm 100 percent truly satisfied. Even it the shower washing my face it didn't come off. I use a very small amount of coconut oil to take it off. I'm planning to buy 10 of them and keep them away for stocking stuffers next Christmas and buy myself a few so I don't need to worry about running out anytime. Thank You!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I am super picky about mascara. My absolute favorite mascara is $28, but since that’s just not practical I’ve been using butterfly intenza for about 10 years now. I’m also sensitive to different mascaras (burning watery eyes). I decided to take the risk for $5 and I am super impressed. I have been using a curved wand for so long now that using a flat wand again is going to take some getting used to. It definitely builds on itself, but it dries super fast so you have to be fairly quick or you start getting that spider leg look. I’ve been wearing it for a few hours and so far I’ve not had any issues with my eyes burning or watering which is good. This may be my new go to if it holds up at work! I took several pictures. The first one is of one eye with one layer of mascara and the other with nothing and the rest is once I was done."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This mascara comes in such a cute tube. It is very black and barely flakes at all unless I mess with it too much. I feel like it takes forever sometimes to remove all of it, but it is so worth it for the effect that it gives.  I really like the wand. The rubber grippies on the cap are nice and the boar bristle brush is tapered well and gives great control.  I get the best results when I wiggle the brush at the base of my curled lashes first and then work upward. Then I comb through from the base to the tips of my lashes with a metal lash comb and remove any clumps with my fingernails between coats.  This picture is with ONE coat on my fairly short and stubby lashes. I’ll try to remember to add a picture with two coats at some point, but I’m still amazed every time I use it.  It is my absolute favorite mascara and I hope they never stop making it!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I absolutely love this mascara. Alone or with another mascara it's my #1 essential. This mascara will absolutely catch every last bit of length on your lash. It's not clumpy, it doesn't have to be heavy if you aren't heavy handed and really does an amazing job. I not use this in conjunction with another essence mascara as well as a magnetic mascara and my lashes look almost like multiple sets of false lashes. I love this mascara so much I have bought it as gifts for birthdays and mothers day and I refuse to run out. I prefer this to the waterproof because it goes on a bit smoother in my opinion. I cannot stress enough how essential this mascara is. With or without any other layering or whatever extent you take your makeup, this mascara alone will get the entire lash shift and lake your lashes look long, full and dynamic. If you're hesitant, just buy it. Amazon always takes easy returns sis and this mascara is a keeper.  If I can find my review later, I'll add a photo."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I stumbled upon this mascara when I was searching for a new brand. I have been wearing Maybelline great lash mascara, waterproof, for as long as I can remember. I had no problems with it until just recently when it was bothering my contact lenses. It’s possible that my mascara had just become old but I decided to search for a new one anyway. The Maybelline was I believe flaking off and get into my contact lenses. This mascara is amazing! It really makes your lashes long and it does not take long to apply. I highly recommend it. Very pleasantly surprised. I had also been hesitant to get a mascara that is not waterproof, because I’m always afraid if I cry or something in my mascara will smudge or smear. I also sometimes get watery eyes so I was afraid of trying a non-waterproof mascara. But this one is great. Give it a try."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have been faithful to Dior's Black Out Mascara for years and years I have no idea what possessed me to try this stuff other than I saw one of my Instagram favorites using it and saying she was obsessed. I bought figuring that the hype was fake and I once again got roped in because I have no self control It was only $4.99 so I figured if I didn't like it, no big deal I tried it and was SHOCKED at how much I LOVED it I curl my lashes and then apply a layer and then let it dry for a second and apply another layer This stuff to me is way better than the expensive stuff that I have purchased in the past I just ordered 4 more..I don't ever want to run out of this mascara"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This is the most amazing mascara I've used in abso-freaking-lutely years! I've been using Superhero mascara by IT cosmetics, and I loved that one, but I'll never go back to it. I can't believe I'd never heard of this mascara, nor the brand...because I'm a makeup junkie and I'm always on the lookout for new and better cosmetics. I didn't have high hopes for this mascara due to the low price, but after seeing other user's pictures in the reviews, and the overall large number of positive reviews I figured I couldn't go wrong for just $5.00. Right away I noticed that there is no strong smell. There's barely a smell at all The consistency is just right. It's not so thick that it requires great effort to put it on, and definitely not a thin mascara. It goes on beautifully! You can just keep applying until you achieve the length and fullness you want. I recommend not letting the coats dry in between in order to gain the best results...but you can easily do touch up applications without any problems. I fell asleep for a nap at one point and when I woke up I did have some smudging under and around my eyes, but no flakes. I was surprised there was no flaking at all while wearing it. The shade of black is nice and dark, and nearly eliminated my need to wear eyeliner. I did not swim while wearing it, but I had a good cry and while it didn't stay completely put it certainly did not run down my face. I personally prefer washable mascara to waterproof for daily wear anyway, because it's gentler on your lashes. Anyway.... I'm going to post pics for your own judgement. I did not edit the pics. The only eye makeup I have on is the Essence - Lash Princess - False Lash Effect mascara that this review is for. I hope you find this helpful! ****The first photo is one of my natural lashes for comparison.****"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Five bux for mascara? Can this be good? Well, yes...and no.  The large, long black plastic tube is shaped a bit like the bust and hips of a woman, with a flared top and puff paint, sort of a corset design (! lace in back, heart-shaped bustier in front outlined in aqua rubbery paint) The puff design lets you grip the top and screw it open. So far, so good.  The wand on this version (not waterproof) is straight and thinner. Not a teddy bear style brush. More like Lash Dimension from L'Oreal.  The mascara ink itself is thick and very black but wet, not dry.  One swoop across my lashes and they were definitely longer and blacker, not volumized but thicker for sure (not as thick as L'Oreal Voluminous, which is my go-to drugstore mascara.) Good separation. Overall, the look was just as I like my mascara to look.  One swipe application is full on with only a touch up of the corners to put on a complete coat of black mascara.  Now the not-so-good. It flakes. At first, I thought it must be a tubing mascara (apparently it is not) because I had little short straight flakes under my eye after a short nap.  It seemed to come off easily enough. I washed my face with my usual Garnier Refreshing Facial Wash with Aloe and no trace is left. I'd say also, I had it on all day on a hot day so by the end of the day it seems to be mostly gone. I'm thinking it would make raccoon eyes or much smearing underneath if you put it on and took it off right away. Nor does it seem to last, say, sixteen hours. You'll be touching it up after eight hours.  Another note: if you use shimmery eye shadow, it will end up clinging to this mascara. Even after it dries. So it doesn't seem to dry right away or it stays a bit tacky. Shimmery or glittery shadow dusts off quite a bit and it really coated my lashes visibly which some mascaras do not do.  So... fairly good formula for application, goes on a treat. I did not get eye irritation, which I am prone to. But seems to flake. Er.... flaking is not cool. I loved the way it made my lashes look and it's no fuss to apply and cheap as can be (cheaper than the typical eight bux drug store brands unless there is a BOGO sale happening) but flaking is so Not. Cool. This is like thinking I'm buying a bargain Princess Diana but getting Duchess Meghan (beautiful! but high maintenance?)"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","My lashes are nearly invisible without mascara. I've tried so many mascaras. Even high end ones left me disappointed. Saw a youtuber rave about this one and BOOM, I'm in love! Recently, loreal came out with a new one (rose-pink packaging; can't recall name ) that everyone was raving about. Curiosity got me and I dropped $10 to see if it could beat princess... nope. Close, but no. Oh, and I do cheat with define-a-lash (mabeline?) to comb out lashes before & after princess, but I do that with any mascara because mine are so puny."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","My favorite mascara was discontinued (Rimmel- Lash Accelerator) about a year ago & I have literally tried EVERYTHING at the drugstore; I am not happy with ANY of them & I refuse to pay over $20 for mascara. I have heard the rave reviews for Lash Princess but It's nowhere to be found- except on Amazon! It's so cheap I had to give it a go. I LOVE THIS MASCARA! It's volumizing & slightly lengthening, not clumpy at all. It held up very well in humidity all day long without flaking, I'd say it's quite WATER RESISTANT & nearly waterproof! I used eyedrops 3x & got my lashes wet accidentally- I dabbed gently under my lower lashes with a tissue, then left it alone to dry. They were just fine like they'd never been wet. I really prefer a mascara that is water-resistant but can be easily melted off by splashing with pretty warm water while gently petting the mascara off my lashes. This mascara doesn't come off that easily. I get raccoon eyes smudged underneath & some mascara still remained on my lashes. MIcellar wipes did not remove that mess either; soap & water got the rest very easily though. I tried this with the Essence lash primer which is a no go for me. It was a clumpier result & I hate seeing any little bit of white that I missed. Mascara goes on smoothly on it's own & I prefer it that way=)"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I honestly love this mascara. I don’t usually like buying $20 mascaras because I’d rather spend my money on things I need rather than want. It makes my lashes look really nice. It does clump a bit but it’s not extreme. I few things about this product. Firstly, my problem is that after a long day, the mascara tends to smear on my eyelids if I sweat. They make my lashes really long so if I open my eyes too wide, it smears a bit off right below my eyebrow but it’s not a lot and easy to wipe off with my finger. Secondly, it is a bit difficult to get off. I usually have to wash my face and lightly rub my eyelashes sideways and then use a makeup wipe to take off the rest. I don’t mind doing this because it doesn’t smudge of wear off during the day if I get my face wet. If you want easy to remove mascara, it’s probably not the product to buy but it does last. Lastly, it doesn’t come with a plastic seal. If you’re freaked out by this, probably don’t get it. I don’t mind because I try not to use plastic. It’s a waste and bad for the environment. But that’s my opinion. I will be buying this product again. It’s extremely affordable and an overall great product. There is some cons to this item (like almost every item someone buys) but there is also pros. If none of the cons bother you, I’d give this mascara a try. It’s pretty cheap to try out and if you end up liking it, that’s great."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",I have ordered this mascara from Ulta several times and have been blown away by how amazing it is! I ordered from Amazon because I figured it would be easier. I used it for 3 weeks and have seen significant loss of my eyelashes and even had a sty. I’m meticulous about my makeup removal and I only use quality skin care and the only change is the source of my mascara. Coincidence? Maybe. But I won’t risk it again. Buy your makeup directly from the company or a trusted source. I wish I had learned that before I lost my beautiful eyelashes! :(
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This is my favorite kind right now. I don’t have the best eyelashes and after wearing false eyelashes for a while, some of mine curled in a weird way. Length just isn’t something I was blessed with and I have light brown hair. But this stuff, thanks to a buzzfeed article basically selling it to me, changed the game. I tried it because it was inexpensive and it did NOT disappoint. I’ve already bought a second one just to be ready for when this one is done. It’s mascara so don’t expect miracles but I have eyelashes now. It does the job. They stand out. There’s some length. It’s a good brush and really, it comes down to the brush. This is the good stuff."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I just received my latest order - I've ordered 5 so far! It exceeded my expectations! For the first time ever, someone commented on the length of my eyelashes, without me batting them even! And the fact that they are also cruelty and gluten free, really makes me love this product more! And the price is absolutely unbelievable - Great product, significantly makes my eyelashes look sumptuous, in a good, natural way- I'm buying some for all my girls that use mascara too! It's smudge proof and long lasting- easy to remove- my eyelashes never feel fused together or 'plasticky' Try it, it might become your favorite too- You could pay way, WAY more, and I have, but why should you?

"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","honestly, why spend $20-$30 on one mascara when this one is as good if not equal or better and looks cute when you are holding it as well. gives volumne and length and holds up well throughout the day making this old womans eyelashes look like she put on some false ones. I have tried probably a thousand mascaras in my lifetime and this is a steal and one of my top ten I would buy over and over. there is nothing about it I dont like. dont let the price being so reasonable stray you from thinking this is not high quality plus low toxic and better to put on your body, for those concerned about what to put on your lashes."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Play Video  Love the volume it adds, but nothing to crazy. Dark look, and separates with volume that I love."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I ordered this mascara after a Youtuber recommended it; it surpassed even her recommendation, and I have already ordered my third tube! My favorite is the False Eyelash Effect. I have been wearing this product daily for over a month, and it is wonderful. I wear contacts, and there is no flaking, smudging, nothing. I have sensitive eyes, but this has not bothered me at all. I put on far fewer layers of this mascara so it takes less time and product to get the effect I want. It also washes off easily; I use the Neutrogena face cloths and water. I cannot say enough great things about this mascara; and the fact that it is gluten and cruelty free at this price makes it a wonderful bargain. I'm putting it on Subscribe and Save!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",This is the best mascara on the market. I bought it during Amazon Prime days when it was recommended as a must buy. I checked out the reviews and they were all raving about this inexpensive mascara. Since it was $3 I figured I'd give it a try. I was blown away on my first application. I'm not going to write a long drawn out review about this mascara. All I've got to say is it beats ALL THOSE EXPENSIVE HIGH END mascaras on the market. It gives the look of false eye lashes but still looks natural. Would give it 10 stars if I could. I just love love love this mascara. Will never buy those other mascaras ever again. You won't be disappointed with this one. I'm in my 60s and I do know a thing or 2 about makeup or so I thought until I ran into this baby. Enjoy looking fabulous.
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I saw a review for this mascara on the internet. I wasn't that impressed with the reviews of the other products mentioned but this one caught my eye. It sounded good and wasn't expensive so I thought I would give it a try. I am in my sixties and my eyelashes aren't as full as they used to be. I used to be able to wear any mascara when I was younger but for many years I have tried one mascara after another without any real success. I don't know if it is the brush or the actual mascara but this one is amazing! It went on great, did not smudge, and stayed on all day. Also, my eyelashes actually show up. I put on a few coats with no lumping. It also works well on my lower lashes. Before I had to have two different mascaras for top and bottom lashes. Love it!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","My eyes are so sensitive that I rarely change anything about my eye makeup but I took a chance (no reaction). I could immediately tell it lengthened better than anything I've ever used. Then I went on with my day, which included pressure washing around the house. Anyone who has done this knows you get a lot of blowback in the face. I never looked in the mirror until hours after I had finished. No flaking, no smudging (raccoon eyes), the mascara looked like it did when I applied it. I was amazed. I tried it because I was so tired of always having little flakes of mascara under my eyes. This doesn't do that, even when you're blasted with water. And the price? I've been looking at mascaras that cost $24 and up. This is an amazing bargain. What's not to love? This is my now my mascara of choice every day."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I've bought just about every type of mascara on the market in search of something that enhances lashes rather than wearing falsies... I believe I have FINALLY found the winner with this mascara! First, lets talk about the packaging. SUPER CUTE! I love the shape of the tube and the colors used. It's girly and fun! The product is amazing. When applying to your lashes you will notice instantly the volume you get on each lash. The brush is made to separate your lashes individually so that you aren't getting clumps of goop on your lashes and it doesn't push your lashes together. THANK GOODNESS! I apply 2 coats and I'm good to go! I'll absolutely be purchasing this again for myself and for Xmas gift bag toss ins!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I, like many of you, have tried so many different mascara's in attempts to find the one that makes your lashes gorgeously POP! Let me add, I've also done lash extensions, as well as other expensive salon techniques. Well, after my investments in so many brands out there, I thought ""why not try this at that price"", and after reading all the reviews. It's true!!! This works!!! It's amazing!!! I have gorgeous lashes at an amazing price of $4.99. Seriously?!!!! Yes, seriously!!! Now, the clump part. What mascara doesn't eventually clump...they ALL do. But, remember due to the wax ingredients, what other people have recommended about heating it up WORKS. So, throw a quick warm blow dry on the tube for any mascara, move the wand around and clumps be gone. I'm not one to typically rate beauty products. But this one I had to, it's an amazing mascara. For $4.99, isn't it work a try?!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I’m REALLY loving this mascara! I have very short and thin eyelashes and this mascara really gives them the volume and length I so desperately need!! I was a LOYAL user of the L’Oréal Voluminous mascara (for a decade, at least)... and this one is really giving it a run for its money - and it’s half the cost! It flakes just a little, but that may be due to the number of coats I use - which I’m realizing more than two coats may not needed. Overall, happy with the purchase. I’ve recommended to others to try and will continue to purchase."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I've always used headliner brands like Mac or Lancome. A friend said the Lash Princess is every bit as good and suggested I try it.  She was wrong. It's BETTER. My lashes are short and need a LOT of help. This product has a great brush that separates as it applies just the right amount. Allows me to layer (because I need the extra boost) but if I had better lashes it would only require one coat. It definitely adds a good amount of length and lasts through the day, no smudging or flaking. Absolutely amazing product and worth 5 times the price.  Hint: I use the Costco Kirkland brand face wipes to remove the mascara and it works really well. My normal liquid just didn't work.  I've left it on overnight and it did flake and smudge little. A little wipe around my eyes because I was rushed - and I wore it a second day!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性"," I dont know how this mascara is ranked so highly. I guess not everyone was sent what I was sent? I received this tonight and realized right away how light the bottle was. There was barely any product in the bottle. I tested it out. You can see the little bit of mascara that does come out clumps up in the corner of the lash wand (where I wiped it off) and barely any product on the lash wand itself. The little product that did come out looked clumpy and old. Its the first time I tried this mascara and I won't ever ne purchasing this again. Also, FAIR WARNING: If you buy any other bottle besides the $5 bottle with free shipping you will be charged $40 for shipping for one bottle of mascara! Im surprised this is allowed on Amazon. I will be reporting this defected product to Amazon."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I’m really impressed! I used to have beautiful eyelashes. They would touch my eyebrows with mascara on. Since my mid 40’s and now I’m 52, I have tiny sparse eyelashes (Mother Nature is unforgiving and has a crappy sense of humor). I ordered this mascara accidentally. I was looking for eyelash glue (I’ve been wearing false lashes so I look like I have some). At first I thought it was glue and ordered it. When I got it in the mail I was actually quite annoyed over my mistake, but decided to try it. I’m so glad I did! I’ve finally found a regular mascara to use all the time... and the best part about it is my eyelashes look great and I don’t have to wear the fake ones (unless I want a more dramatic look). Anyway, I would really recommend this mascara! It’s inexpensive and even does a better job than the $30 “It Super Hero” mascara I used to buy! I will say that it will slightly smudge if you rub your eyes. It’s not quite waterproof, but will not run if you get it wet and it’s relatively easy to take off with soap and water or makeup remover. It is the best mistake of a purchase that I’ve ever made."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Ok so my #1 makeup product is mascara, I can't walk out the door without it. Having said that I've tried a lot from drugstore to high end, my top favorite always being Lancome and this essence brand one is even better than my favorite Lancome mascara, and for the price it just can't be beat. I love big huge lashes and this provides it, you can do a bit more natural but I go for the bug huge chunky lashes. When it comes to lashes, more is better for me, and this builds up fast and although they look chunky they don't look clumpy if that makes sense, like each lash looks fat but they don't clump up with each other, and if they do you can separate them easily. I just love it. I'm ordering another one right now, but I just had to leave a review."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This is the mascara of all mascaras. I can't believe the time and money I spent over the years trying to find THE one. I used to sell a fiber lash mascara with a company. It was hot for a while. I loved it and so did my customers. The only problem was the flaking of the fibers ended up on the tops of my cheeks and under my eyes. It even went in my eyes but I ignored it because it looked good . New brands came out that sold similar products for a cheaper price, so that was the fizzle of my mascara selling career.  I then tried lash extensions. It was expensive and time-consuming. I didn't like not being able to wear mascara with it, so I started buying fake lashes. I was getting pretty good at applying them and found a few styles I liked, but I was concerned when a few lashes started coming off. Even when I would try to remove them as gently as possible, they were taking off some of my own lashes. I don't know if I was imagining it, or it was a result of getting older, the lash extensions or the adhesive from fake ones, but my own lashes seemed to get thinner and appear shorter. I started having trouble creating the full look I used to have with mascara alone....even multiple coats.  That's when I started my Amazon hunt and this product came up as one of the best. $4.99 and the option to return if I wasn't happy, it was a no-brainer. I figured compared to the others on the best selling list in the $17 to $25 price range, there was no way this cheap one would work. I read the reviews, looked at the before and after pictures, and didn't hesitate with my purchase.  The day I got this mascara, I also got one that was highly recommended on Amazon for $17. I tried this cheap one first. From the first few Strokes I could tell this was a homerun. With every brush my lashes seem to grow longer. It was truly amazing. I took a picture with this one on one side and nothing on the other. It was pretty fantastic! I tried the more expensive one on the other eye with no mascara. Nope. Big fail. Not even close to being as good as this one. Headed to returnville.  You have absolutely nothing to lose by trying this mascara and it is a huge mistake for you not to. It is cheaper than 90% of the drugstore brands and if you don't like the ones in the local stores, for the most part you can't return them. I plan to buy another one for myself and then 1 for my mother-in-law whose lashes thinned a lot during her ongoing cancer battle.  I haven't tried to remove it yet. I'm one of those women who doesn't stress about taking her eye makeup off at night. Also, like someone else here commented, mine did not come sealed or in any type of box. I know it's not the best to get an unsealed product, but I took my chances and love it. I promise you will too!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have wanted to join the longer lash trend now for some time. Not willing to pay hundreds of dollars for extensions or to use the ones that you glue on yourself. So, I’ve been looking for the perfect lash extending mascara. But that was in my budget. Not sure about the smudge proof aspect of this yet, but I know it doesn’t “fall “off in specks like some other mascaras do. I don’t always take my mascara off at night before bed and it still looks pretty good the next day and I don’t have black eyes from it. I do take it off with make up remover and it comes off well. It doesn’t clump together my lashes like a previously bought Amazon choice of mine. I’m happy with this one and have recommended it to other people. I can see why it’s the number one seller right now."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",Never will I ever be without this mascara. I've got short thin lashes and have had a graveyard of mascara that I would constantly give to my friend or daughter because they never lived up to the hype. This is amazing. I will sometimes add a fiber thing with it to make it even better but it's great on its own.  And the price makes it even more ridiculous. I seriously had my doubts but I'm a total fan now after using it. Getting ready to but another tube now. It's lasted three months so far and I use it pretty much daily. I can't tell how much is left but I don't want to risk being without it.
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",Purchased this based on reviews and price. I had been using a $32 mascara which was a splurge but my aging lashes needed a good plumping mascara and store brands were no longer doing the trick Well I was soooo surprised and impressed how very Awesome this mascara is. Very accurate description and see why reviews are so good. The price is amazing for such a high quality product. This is now my staple mascara and I am beyond pleased to finally have one I can afford easily! Thank you
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I am 68 years old and have been using makeup for 52 of those years. I have tried many mascaras over those years from inexpensive to very expensive. I cannot say that I have ever been really happy with the results. I had reached the point where I thought that, it does not matter the cost, they are pretty much all the same. This changed my mind. I put on two coats and it made my lashes look so thick. If I did not know better, I would think that I had on false eyelashes. I used baby shampoo, as I always do and I always lather with the baby shampoo twice, to remove the mascara, and it came off easily. I will look no more for a new mascara. I cannot imagine a mascara better than this."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I really LOVE this mascara. It lengthens, separates and adds volume all in one, which is very hard to find. My eyes are sensitive and most mascaras I've tried make my eyes sting or water but not this one. This will clump all over the place if you're not careful and apply too much all at once. It does dry fast and most days I only put 3 coats because I want to build length and it dries out fast. This mascara hasn't run or anything but it's not water proof either. If my eyes start watering from allergies then it will smudge a little under my eye but that's about it. The mascara stays on all day until I'm ready to wash it off with soap and water. My lashes are tiny so what this mascara does for me is a miracle for under 5 dollars."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","For 5 bucks, this is phenomenal mascara. It’ll lengthen and volumize your eyelashes better than most. It’s not quite as good as Perversion or Monsieur Big but I think most people probably won’t even notice the difference in the final effect. It super black, doesn’t clump, and doesn’t dry down immediately so you can really build up the color and length. I have very fine colorless eyelashes and need all the help I can get to get them to show up, and this does the trick. It does occasionally wind up on my upper lid, but I have massive lids and I think it’s a little more wet than what I’m used to so just be a little deliberate and mindful and you’ll be fine. My only beef with this is that it’s tricky to take off. You have to wait after applying makeup remover (I use MUFE sens eyes). Then very gently rub your eyes. It’ll melt if you give it time."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I love this mascara. Purchased as emergency on a trip and fell in love. Now this is the 3 one I purchase, just hope I can continue finding it whenever I need it. I'm trying another products from the same brand and they exceeded my expectations! ♡ THANK YOU!!  Me encanta!! Lo compre de emergencia porque me tiraron los mios en el aeropuerto en un viaje y me fascino!! Solo espero poder seguir encontrarlo cada que lo necesite. Ahora estoy probando mas productos de esta marca y hasta ahora todos han superado mis expectativas! ♡  GRACIAS!!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I have to preface this by saying that I do have eyelashes that are naturally on the longer side; HOWEVER, I still feel like I have some great points to put on the table. Seeing that I do have naturally long eyelashes, mascara shopping has never really been a big issue for me (aside from trying to find one that will add volume and length without clumping). With that being said, in my ten years of trying HUNDREDS of mascaras, I have NEVER seen a mascara perform as well as this one. I’ve tried Benefit, Tarte, L’oréal, Maybelline, It Cosmetics, YOU NAME IT, and NONE have ever come close to this $5 DOLLAR MASCARA. They’ve always been prone to clumping, or have fallout or flakiness, and take extra effort to ensure perfect application. This took me literally NO EFFORT. The pictures shown in my “after” photos are TWO COATS that have been achieved with no weird hand movements or brush twirling. Also, even though I have long eyelashes, they’ve never looked this long before with any mascara, EVER. Especially with no clumps!  If you don’t want to read my rant, here’s a summary of what I liked and what I think could use improvement!  PROS: -Easy application -No clumping -No flaking off after hours of wear -No smudging or fallout underneath the eyes -Great wand that allows for an even dispersion of product with minimal effort -Long wear (haven’t cried in it though, so can’t comment on that lol) -Extreme length -Great volume, without causing clumsiness -CHEAP AS HELL  CONS: -The only thing I can think to mention here is that it is CRUCIAL that you wait for the first coat to dry before doing touch ups or other coats. I noticed that it was a *tiny bit* more prone to clumping if I didn’t wait for everything to dry before going back in and adjusting something or adding anything."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","This mascara is unbelievable!! I couldn't believe that I went from pretty much no lash to what a pair of false eyelashes look like. My husband noticed it immediately and asked ""how much did you spend on fake eyelashes??"" When I showed him it was this mascara he couldn't believe it. My friends thought the same thing and are now purchasing this instead of their normal fancy name brand mascara. Unfortunately it does smudge, but it's not horrible, and easily fixed with the swipe of a wet q-tip. That has only happened after a long day of me working horses and stacking hay or when my allergies kick in. On a regular day I've never had an issue. I use a simple eye makeup remover oil and it comes right off. It's seriously worth the purchase. I'm so glad I finally found a mascara that actually works!! (It's a major bonus when I use my eyelash curler with it!!)"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","OH MY GOD! Honestly I think the picture says it all but I’m going to repeat it. My lashes have NEVER been so big and beautiful. I had get as much of the product off the brush as I could before even applying it and still after one swipe my lashes did that! I’m not kidding! I am notorious for finding cheap make up. My bow pencil is drug store, my bb cream is from dollar tree (sassy chic you can buy the exact same product from amazon for $6), my high lighter is dollar tree and even my lipsticks come from there. But when it came to mascara, oof. I couldn’t keep buying $1 products because they just didn’t do their job. They clumped my lashes together and looked so bad. I ended up buying a $3 one that was even worse! So, I finally did it. And my god this thing is worst $20. It is the best mascara I have ever used and I have ever seen. This is a must-by. I am so in love"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","Don't mind the bad pictures, I didn't have any other makeup on other than this mascara. I don't have time in the mornings before work to do much so I apply only one quick coat on my blonde lashes and it still looks really great. When I actually put effort into my makeup, this mascara looks amazing! But I wanted people to see how good the quick and dirty application looks with this since we aren't always going all out on our makeup. I really love that it's gluten free too! I have celiac disease and while I don't tend to snack on my mascara, it does sometimes end up in my mouth (usually because I rub my eyes a lot and lick my fingers later for some reason or another - usually food related), so a gluten free mascara is needed! But I will say this mascara doesn't clump like the other ones I've had so I don't really even need to worry about having those little clump balls fall down my face and into my mouth either! I know this is not waterproof mascara, but it sure seems pretty darn water resistant! It held strong when I spent the day playing in the yard with my dogs while sprinklers were shooting around. It's also tougher to wash off than other non-waterproof mascaras I've used. I don't buy waterproof because I don't like how long it takes to wash off but this one is worth it, in my opinion, and still not as difficult to remove as actual waterproof mascara. I also love the low price too! Yay!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I was ""influenced"" to try out this mascara and I am completely blown away! This stuff is so amazing, especially at the price point. I have naturally long lashes but they're blonde at the tips so they tend to not look as long. This mascara coats the entire lash, giving me amazing length. Also the brush and the formula does a spectacular job of separating out the lashes without clumping. It lasts throughout my 10 hour work day and the gym afterwards. I use my normal, oil-based make-up remover to take it off at the end of the day. This product is 10/10 the best mascara I have ever used. I actually just ordered an additional 3-pack from Amazon."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","LOVE THIS!  my eye lashes look so long, full and are not all caked & stuck together. The best $5 investment I’ve purchased in awhile.  I’m really picky about my mascara, I can’t stand when they look clumpy or flakey and I hate when they look thin and have no volume.  I wanted my lashes to look full, bold and long without sacrificing for cakey flakey volumeless lashes, this gave me exactly what I wanted!  You only need a little, make sure to wipe the excess mascara on the inside of the bottle before applying because I didn’t at first and I had black mascara splashes all over the top of my eyelids 😂 aside from that I love it. It stays on all day, but it takes no effort to remove with a single makeup wipe.  The reviews were really good as well as the price, you can’t even get decent drug store mascara for $5. that’s what lead me to try it, I’m so pleased I took the chance! It’s comparable to “better than sex” mascara, I actually like it more.  I can’t wait to try the other versions of this brand! Very pleased!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","My name is Kim and I'm a mascara junkie/snob. I try and have tried so many mascaras I wouldn't even know where to begin. I try them all, drugstore brands, internet only brands, chain cosmetic store brands, you name it. For the past year + I have repeatedly chosen this one over the fancy brands. The consistency of the formula is perfect for me. It allows me to get the applicator to the base of my lashes and do the wiggle which really builds nice volume at the lash line, but it also gives length! Nothing clumps, I'm able to achieve lash separation perfectly. To me, half the mascara experience is the brush, and this one to me is perfect. Tapered enough to get the tiny ones in the corners and not so big that you get it everywhere. It doesn't flake, it lasts all day with no smudging and EASILY removes. I've tried the other formulas in this line and they're good but this one is by far my fave. Give it a try, you won't break the bank!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I love this stuff. I have really crappy eye lashes. Naturally, in my opinion, they look short and like they stick straight out of my eyelid even after curling. No mascara ive used, including expensive mascaras, have ever made them look a way i was happy with. Then I ordered this mascara! With just 1 coat they look gorgeous, long, lifted, and not apidery or stuck together. I have also cried wearing this mascara, which i dont believe is water proof, and it didnt run all over my face!! It does come off with minimal effort at the end of the day, i havent notived any flaking throughout the day, and it hadnt irritated my eyes at all, with or without my contacts in! Ill definitely be buying more of this mascara!"
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性","I'm 59 and always roll my eyes at mascara commercials because they so often use young women who have long lashes to begin with. But, after reading a couple of really positive reviews for this product on Facebook, I decided to try it. I'm so glad I did! I really like the formulation AND the brush. I don't know why this brush works so well, it looks pretty basic although it's a little longer than most others, but it does a great job of coating and separating lashes and (maybe because of the length) it makes it easier to get to the inner lashes that are hard to reach without poking yourself. The formulation is smooth and doesn't clump and isn't smeary, it's easy to remove with eye makeup remover. It's also priced right, less than the L'Oreal Voluminous mascara that I've used for years. If you're on the fence about trying it, go ahead. You won't be disappointed."
"精华 | Lash Princess 假睫毛效果睫毛膏 | 不含麸质,无刺激性",I usually purchase VERY expensive make up BUT somehow I came across this & the reviews were so good that I decided to give it a shot.... and I'm soooooooo glad I did! I love it!!! LOVEE!! It seriously works so good. Never again going elsewhere. haha  ***I have average eye lashes not long unfortunately but this made them stand out and look like they had length. I wish I had known it comes in waterproof before I got the non waterproof even though WP is more harsh on eye lashes. My eyes tend to water easily but they didn't today so I can't tell you how easy it runs but today I had no problems at all. It lasted from noon to 11 at night.  *Ignore the messiness in the photos attached. I quickly did it and on one of my eyes my eye lashes have an area that got pulled out from my lash curler so its growing back still so it looks off. lol

Smells delightful, too. I gave up the Ponds wipes for these, and I thought Ponds was the best ever! I don't have the problem some users report, of the wipes drying out because the package doesn't seal. I have a package in every room AND the car, so they're in use for a long time.

Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆洁面湿巾 日常清洁面巾可去除防水化妆品和睫毛膏 不含酒精 超值两件装 25 支装 2 件装,These are amazing !!! I’m a teenage girl who LOVES to do crazy makeup looks just for fun all the time so I always need to have makeup wipes with me. I ordered these because my old ones burnt my eyes (Yes to cucumbers). First thoughts were that they arrived on time and in perfect condition. First time I used one of these wipes it was to remove a LOT of makeup and these definitely did the trick! It didn’t take a lot to remove all the makeup just soft swipes and one wipe removed all of the makeup. These are very gentle on the eyes so I didn’t experience any type of burning which is great since I have very sensitive skin! Not only was I already happy with these but the next two days I realized the benefits it brought to my skin! My skin was way more softer and definitely was the most Hydrated it had been in a while. Love these makeup remover wipes and will be buying them again! Definitely recommend 😄

Cheap makeup wipes burn my eyes and make my skin feel dry and taut, but these actually make my skin feel moisturized and amazing. I actually look forward to using them before bed because of how quick they are and how smooth they make my skin feel. Super light scent, too, not overpowering at all!"

Their great for a lazy night of cleaning your face. I use this as a 3 part tool taking off my makeup. I was tired of bleaching my washcloths b/c my makeup stains the fabric. I use these wipes first, then some Micellar water then follow by normal night time washing & moisturizing. These don't dry out your face. If you're using them to clean up an error, it doesn't wipe the entire area so you have to reapply. Targets just where you wipe."

And now I'm going BACK TO NEUTROGENA!! I was trying to look for a ""healthier"" alternative.  And as far as my skin goes I'm pretty damn lucky. I barely break out and if I do its 1 or twice a year and I'm not sensitive to products so its really odd for all of those to suck!  FYI *** Aveeno burned around my eyes after a few days of using then it left a weird dry burn looking area around my eyes. Went away after I stopped using it.  ***Cerave was 1000X worse burning all over face but no marks left at least. Just the burn was all over and lasted a few minutes.  *** And burts bees didn't remove anything make up wise. It was crap for make up removing.. No waterproof and non waterproof eyeliner as well... along with foundation and powder. ITS good for after a work out or outside in the garden maybe but not for make up removal."

Not to mention....living in Mississippi summers with 300% humidity, working outside in a high retail store for 20 years...need I say more? Great for on the go & vacations. Reseal works til last cloth! Never dries out. This cleans deep. Even after a shower, these wipes still reveal dirt left behind average washing with anything used in shower. Gels, body washes, bar soaps, used on face. No clogging of pores. Face feels squeaky clean. No more blemishes of any kind. I love the grapefruit scent. Preferred over regular scent, even though it smells good too. I can use this for bottom lash eyeliner removal without upper extensions losing adhesive. I hope this product will never be discontinued."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆洁面湿巾 日常清洁面巾可去除防水化妆品和睫毛膏 不含酒精 超值两件装 25 支装 2 件装,I've purchased these moist makeup remover wipes by Neutrogena for years and years now. I was running low and didn't want to run in the local store to search for them so I looked online and found them here. I've always bought the fragrance-free ones just to be on the safe side and never had any issues. They remove my makeup very easily with minimal tugging or pulling as you might expect. My only complaint is that they can get dried out if the little piece over the top of the package is not sealed properly. I solved this issue by buying a single pack that came with a hard little shell case to put them in and haven't had them dry out since. Overall a great product that I'll continue to buy =)

I usually get the regular formula, however I purchased fragrance-free accidentally, and hoo-boy what a lucky mistake! These perform exactly as expected, but the fragrance-free-fragrance is so much more tolerable; furthermore, there seems to be a difference in the formula’s texture, which I greatly prefer in the fragrance-free version. Definitely repurchasing in the future."

This product is amazing! It’s gentle, my eyes have never burned even a little! it takes off all my make up with one towelette. I thought I was gonna have to buy one of those little scrubbers and get in there to get all the makeup off and have to get my shirt all wet while I tried to get the makeup off after putting extra soap on my face. None of that has to be done. I use the towelette, put moisturizer on and Done!"

I don’t find that these pre-wet cloths can completely remove a fully made up face of makeup, but it works well for cleaning face in morning or after a workout or at the end of a no/very light makeup day. I would not use them for traveling because I would have to carry another product for finishing makeup removal. I prefer the Oil of Olay cleansing clothes that foam up when you get them wet for travel and full makeup removal.

I have sensitive skin, so in the past I could not ever get rid of all my makeup in one wipe and ome face washing. I mean ALL my make-up ... which includes triple layered mascara (since I have crappy lashes poor me yes, I know lol) black eyeliner, brown eye brows... and ALL of my eye shadow... yes!! all of it!! Let me repeat... NEVER has this happened with one wipe and one washing of my face. Also use Neutrogena face wash, which I also love.  Now not only am I able to get rid of all my makeup, but my skin does not break-out over harsh scrubbing (these are soft wipes yet still do the job) or have an oily residue. Also there is literally no smell. I have never found make-up removing wipes which DO everything and NO side effects. In the past with previous wipes, never would one wipe do everything...some necessities of a make-up removing wipe, but never all of what I need. These are not even crazy expensive. Well on Amazon they are not at least 😁"

These stores take off almost all of the surface makeup that's visible with the eye and they are clean, beneficial ingredients for the skin. I go through more wipes than I would like, because I also take to the gym, on outside Activities where I know I'm going to sweat, so I was ecstatic to find this 2 pack at this price and it's on my Subscribe and Save. It does exactly what I want.. Gently remove makeup workout being rough on my face, remove built up oil sweat, Makeup after a vigorous gym session or just on hot days when I'm spending a lot of time outside. They have not had any negative traction to my skin. My skin stays smooth, hydrated, glowing, and even. These are a repeat buy always!"

I literally do not leave home without these!

I have combination/oily skin and they do not leave my face feeling greasy or oily either. I LOVE to use these on my clients also! So perfect to remove any type of makeup, even waterproof mascara/eyeliner! I can not boast enough about these! I have these on auto-order and get them every 2 months! They are also cheaper here for a 2 pack than in stores! I HIGHLY recommend them! Oh I also wear contacts, so sometimes with makeup remover, specifically for removing eye makeup, the products are oil based and usually makes my eyes irritated as well as the oil gets INTO my eyes and on my contacts which is a MAJOR pain and that is not the case at all for these! Which is why I LOVE them! Try them if you haven't! You will NOT be disappointed!"

Especially around my eyes. I have used so many different brands so I gave up and just stuck with my Philosophy brand cleanser. My cleanser is good but not convenient for when I get home from working my long shifts. I spent a hefty amount of time reading the reviews on these wipes (because all other wipes burned my face and eyes) The reviews I read were all very good. I ordered them, got them today when I finished working my shift at the hospital, went straight to my bathroom and wiped my face using the neutrogena night time wipe, and let me tell you….. holy cow. It melted my makeup off effortlessly, with no scrubbing. I had ZERO burning and tingling. Not to mention the overwhelming silky smooth feeling it left my face with. Now I’m spending so much time on a review this evening on makeup wipes because they have me so shocked. I’m officially buying these for life."

This doesn't taste funny or bitter or in fact, has no taste at all as wipes inevitably get inside your mouth. Also, it's not too scratchy nor is it so soft that you feel as if it's not even touching your skin. Smells are what REALLY gets me. If I hate the way it smells or if it's overwhelming? FUGGEDABOUTIT. This is a light smell; very refreshing. I guess the only CON I have for this is about 1/4 left of wipes it will begin to get less and less closeable. Then I will have to flip it over so that it stays shut. Most of them do that, so it's not a huge issue."

I love when I travel and they have the little travel sizes ones in the single packet in my hotel room. I wish I could by these in bulk to throw in my suitcase!  Also, wanted to mention, I’ve seen some videos online of people having reactions to these. I work with a company that sells preservatives to water based products including personal care products. I can tell you that there is always going to be a very small percentage of the population that is going to be sensitive to something. It is no way common and the testing involved in selling something that goes on human skin is intense. So take that into consideration!"

They are soaked in makeup remover, they don't burn my eyes which is the most important thing after removing all my makeup which it DOES! I only need about 2 maybe 3 of them depending how much makeup I have on. Usually I only need 2 and it completely removes all my makeup. Plus they have an AMAZING scent to them that's not too powerful yet it stays on your face unless you wash it immediately after. Finally, I have VERY sensitive skin and this was gentle on my skin and I love that considering how powerful they are. I'm living for these."

Each package contains 25 towelettes that are very large and soft and removed all traces of my makeup including my mascara which other MUW removers tend to leave traces of behind because I use lash extending mascara with fibers that attach to the real lash to give it a longer fuller look and these leave your face and neck so soft and hydrated feeling. I have began to use these wipes even on days that I do not even wear makeup because of how good they make my skin feel. I love that these have a fresh clean scent to them that isnt too strong but just enough. Already set up my subscription to automatically send these to me every month.

The size of the cloth is perfect and they are very strong. If you have a lot of make up on, if you keep folding and turning the cloth over, you can actually get ALL of your make up off with one cloth. I wear foundation, powder, eyebrow pencil, eye shadow, blush, mascara, lipstick (all day wear lipstick) and a finishing spray, and so am able to get it all off with just one cloth. I do wash my face with nuetrogena moisturizing was afterwards because the clothes do leave a sort of oily feel to the skin, but if you have dry skin, that’s a better feel than the dry right feeling you can get from other make up remover clothes or just soap and a wash cloth alone. I love these cloths and can’t imagine using any thing else."

Store them face down for maximum solution absorbance. These wipes are very effective in removing longwear lipstick and eye makeup, as well as makeup left on hairline/neck. Be gentle and dont be too abrasive with them.  Not recommended as sole makeup remover, please double cleanse. Use oil based cleanser/balm on dry skin to remove face makeup first. Then use water based cleanser to rinse after.  Have travelled with these on a long vacation and worked well, but probably use the single wipe packs for shorter trips."

I also use the wipes to clean my makeup brushes without spending money to buy make up Remover spray which can get very expensive. The wipes are thick so they remove all my makeup with just 1 wipe. Great buy for the money. Definitely recommended"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆洁面湿巾 日常清洁面巾可去除防水化妆品和睫毛膏 不含酒精 超值两件装 25 支装 2 件装,"I've been buying these for years. I always get the unscented because I have sensitive skin. My skin can also be very dry & I find that these exfoliate& moisturize just enough. They're not too rough & they take off ALL of my eye make-up without any irritation. I wear waterproof eyeliners & mascaras & I had tried using other brand wipes, witch hazel, eye makeup removers (with & without oils), coconut oil, etc. & nothing works as well as these. One wipe gets my full face, eyes & neck. I even clean my ears with the corners of the wipes when I'm done. Then I just go to bed feeling adequately moisturized. If I want to go the extra mile, I run a rose witch hazel cotton pad over my face, spritz my face with rosewater & smother my face in night cream. But that's only on self-care Sunday. I can't say enough how much I adore these. I'm always terrified that one day they'll go off the market! Lawd please no! My only complaint would be that the flap doesn't always keep it's sticky towards the end but that's certainly not enough of a gripe to warrant any less than 5 stars."

Look no further, because this particular Neutrogena make-up remover wipes are by far the most effective in removing all kinds of make-up, including 24-hour lipsticks and waterproof mascaras. I've used it for so long that I can't put a date on it, and I've compared to others now and then. The price is right, and you can buy this in a 2-pack to save even more. They also come in individually-wrapped wipes, which is so helpful if you travel or need to touch up make-up during the day while you are out and about."

I love the two-pack bargain, plus I don't have to order them as frequently.  These work great for removing any makeup that is not water-resistant. For water-resistant makeup (like my eyeliner), I find that I have to use something stronger like micellar water to finish the job.  Also, they will dry out if you don't use them for a while. However, I have found that to be the case with all the different moist towelettes I have used. So, I think it's unavoidable."

I use them every night to take off my makeup and they leave your skin feeling fresh and clean. I need to buy stock in these cause I order them way too often.

I’ve been buying these for the past 6-8 months and I like that they stay moist and ready for any job. The size of the wipes are generous compared to a couple other brands; they’re not soaked with cleanser to the point of dripping, but have a good balance of cleanser on the size of the wipe. They leave my face feeling clean and soft with no residual makeup or soap."

It removes all of my eye makeup and facial makeup and my skin is in better condition after using this product for a couple of weeks. It's very gentle, removes all makeup and leaves my skin feeling very soft. This is all I need. After taking off my makeup with this product I just apply my moisturizer and I'm good to go! This sure beats having to mess up a washcloth every night to take off makeup! So convenient! I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!"

My routine consists of removing makeup, washing with a facial cleanser, toning, followed by moisturizer. This is one of the few products I've tried that remove my makeup so well that by the time I use the toner, there is no residual makeup left on my cotton pad. It leaves a very soft film on your skin so it definitely needs to be followed up with a washing. Because it is in a foil pouch it is easy to pack for traveling. My only complaint would be that the sticky seal on the package gives out about 5 tissues too early making it impossible to keep closed."

Now that I know I can order them on Amazon for a really good price, I've added them to my auto-renewal purchases. It really is worth a little extra for such an excellent product!"

I've been a long-time user of Neutrogena makeup wipes and these don't disappoint. However, I have noticed that during the pandemic (since I am not wearing makeup everyday), these tend to try out before I can use them all. My guess is they probably stay moist for a few months once the package is opened, but start to dry out with time. I never noticed before the pandemic and this was never an issue, but something to think about."

I have to exfoliate my skin at least every other day because it is so dry and with regular wipes I need to put moisturizer on after because the wipes dry me out even more. These wipes are so soft unlike a lot of wipes I’ve tried, I can rub hard and not feel any scratchiness. They also make my skin feel SO moisturized not in a thick or oily way so I love them. I use these wipes even when I don’t have makeup on just to moisturize my face after a shower or before I go to bed."

My skin is prone to dryness when I wash my face but gets very oily throughout the day. This wipe not only takes off all my eye make up (I only do eye make up) in a few swipes with only ONE wipe, but it does not leave my skin around my eye irritated and red like other products. I use neutrogena products religiously lol. I’ve tried other brands but they always leave the corners of my eyes red and irritated as well as not really removing anything without using a couple pads or wipes of their product. 100% recommend"

They're great for sensitive skin, I don't break out with them nor do I feel like they dry my skin out. Plus, they get a lot of stubborn makeup off without a ton of work. I can wear waterproof mascara or eyeliner and not feel like I have to rub my face raw to get the produtt off.  Although, it is awkward getting eyeliner off my bottom lash line because I'm hesitant about bringing the wipe too close to my eyes. I will say that they never caused my eyes to get itchy, irritated or burned.  You still need to wash your face after using the wipe though because it kind of leaves an oily type of feel."

It actually sees to have improved my skin because it removes ALL make up and grime/dirt without being harsh. However, I usually use two wipes to ensure face is thoroughly clean. It even removes the famous double wear foundation and for us gals who wear it, we know how bullet proof that foundation is!"

So, these wipes are perfect for me, as they leave my skin feeling moist and supple. They do a good job of removing my make-up in the easiest way possible.

When I travel I take as many as I need and put into a ziplock baggie and pop into my make up bag, so they are super compact. At least once I have travelled, forgetting to pack my regular face wash and these were great, I removed my make up and then rinsed and applied moisturizer."

"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I would give this a zero if possible. My wife just opened this today as her last container finally ran out. When she opened it, there was nothing in it, not a drop. The application brush is completely dry and brand new still, as if there was NEVER anything in it. Usually the brush is wet when it is new as it is inside the serum. It is already past the date for return so there is nothing that we know of to get a replacement. I hope Amazon can help with this, but there is no way to contact them via the order, so not sure how to get this fixed. We paid over $60 for an empty container. I have included pics of the newly opened-dry serum, a close-up of it, then the old one that is running out, and also a comparison of the new one just opened to the current one we have that has run out. The one that has run out is still wet, but the new one is not wet at all as if there was never anything in it.  Please help amazon. We will still have to order more because it is hard to find this serum and my wife likes it. I guess it would have been better to open it when we first received it and at least check to make sure there is something in it, but we never had trouble with this before, so we did not have any reason to open it until the last one ran out."

The problem is that this seller is slipping counterfeit products in with the legit orders. As with a few of the other customers on here, I received two real vials and then on my third I noticed a counterfeit vial. (See image - left is real, right is counterfeit) After referring dozens of new customers and family members over to this product I will be sure to caution them and refer them to buy from Ulta or Sephora for the exact same price and 100% authenticity. I filed a complaint with Amazon CS and reported them for an investigation as this is a not only an expensive product but also could be a potential liability. We will see what happens I suppose. Be cautious as this seemed to be legit at first."

"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","My esthetician encouraged me to purchase this product, bc she has so many clients that she’s actually saw where their lashes have gotten thicker & longer! So; I bought it for the 1st time in 2017 & I’ve been buying it through Amazon ever since 2017! (bc Grandelash MD charges the same, but bc of the Free Shipping on Amazon & not on their website I choose to order through Amazon!) I usually buy it about every 6-8 months. It says it’s a 3-4 month supply, but I get many more months out of the smallest size! Now... It works if you’ve always had natural longer & thicker lashes. mine have always been thick & long, but as I’ve aged & as I was in my late 40’s is when I began noticing a big difference in my lashes! Once I begin ordering grande lash my lashes have gotten back to the way they used to be! I have friends who have ordered this and it has done the same thing with their lashes, but I also have friends who have ordered it and it hasn’t helped much at all, but they have told me they never had naturally long & thick lashes either. But it has helped every person who has used it atleast a Little back to their old normal lashes even if they haven’t gotten extra benefits from it. Now this is with me using it faithfully! I do not miss an application! So I either apply “every single night or each morning” ! I included a few photos. I really do have so many ppl ask me if my lashes are extensions! My husband has been with me on many occasions when a random female will literally go crazy over my lashes ☺️😍 I love when he’s around, bc he actually hears from random ppl how gorgeous my lashes are & the price HE PAYS for my Grandelash is worth it ❤️ *i included many photos to show that my lashes are really normal length & Chanel Volumizing Mascara is what really help along with the GrandeLash. & no Chanel Mascara isn’t no more costly than the kind u buy at Beauty Product Stores! Believe me it’s worth the $5 more than u may have to pay!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I've been using GrandeLASH-MD for quite a few years. It definitely works. Early this year (2020) I tried a different eyelash and brow serum on Amazon that is cheaper. That other product did not work at all, not on my lashes or brow. I did a side-by-side comparison for the couple months that the other serum said it would take, using it on my right side only. I continued using GrandeLash on my left side. You can see in the photo that my lashes are a lot shorter on my right side, and my eyebrows look identical.  I have since started using the Grande brow product and it also really works! You definitely get what you pay for."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性", I was a little leery about getting this product because of the bad reviews saying that it stains your eyelids and that people had reactions to it so what I did was I bought the three month supply and the first few days I just put a small dot on my eyelid to see if my skin would react. It didn’t so then I started to apply a thin strip as a the directions describe once a day x3 months …since October it is now February I haven’t even used it since January and when I tell you that people come up to me at work patients coworkers even family members they ask me where I got my lashes done I’ve always had long lashes but this product made them fuller longer and stronger I love this product so much that I sent it to my friend for her birthday. I had gotten my lashes done twice extensions and it ruined the lashes my lashes were short stubby falling out and this product completely gave me back my natural lash and more than I could ask for 20 /10 stars
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Made my eyes itch. My eyelids also became very dry. I had an allergic reaction to it. I gave it to my daughter, she loves it"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I’ve always had very thin short sparse lashes. I’ve used Revitalash but never Latisse because I have light eyes (a friend used that and her color changed a bit). Revitalash is pricy and only really made my lashes longer not thicker. This product works great for me, thicker and longer! Many of the 1 star reviews are about irritation - if you’ve never used these products that’s just how they work. Skin around the eyes is very thin and very sensitive so people have varied reactions. I’ve found this product to be much more mild than others, Revitalash turned my eye area pink! Looked like I had makeup on. This product is great and affordable enough to try it out! My lashes are not curled in the pic."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性"," If I could give zero stars I would. The original Grande Lash MD is absolutely amazing I suggest you get it from Ulta that’s where I normally get mine however, I did decide to get it off Amazon this time around. After receiving it I noticed right off the back that the container that it comes in is noticeably difference by the way it feels to heaviness. After using it for 1 months I noticed that my eyelashes were going back to being smaller instead of maintaining the fullness. I went to Ulta and did buy a new one from there. After using it for just two weeks I noticed my eyelashes getting full again. The product itself works but not the one from Amazon it is a knock off. I am in the process of notifying Amazon that they are selling a product it does works. I believe this is why all the negative reviews."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I really wish I would have taken ""before"" pics. My hairdresser told me about this stuff and said ""it works so good I had to stop using it every night."" I thought to myself ""Oh yeah, lashes too long, no such thing"" but I on my second tube and I'm going to start using every other night. My lashes are so long, and it's like I have a double row of lashes. My bottom lashes are thicker too. I rarely write reviews but wanted to share because it really really works."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Most of my life I've had pretty good eyelashes until I got older at which time they started to get much shorter and much less full. I've been leery to try lash serums because so many say can cause your iris to turn brown and I'm fond of my blue grey eye color. I received this product as a free sample and because of the aforementioned issue , I threw it in a drawer and forgot about it. Then desperation set in and I decided to try it. OH MY GOSH!!! Even though I wasn't great about putting it on every single night, after about 3 weeks my I noticed my eyelashes had grown so long I they left smudges of mascara under my brow line. After about 6 weeks, I actually, and this is the absolute truth, had to clip a small area of eyelashes because they got so long that when I opened my eyes they hit my brow line which knocked them to the side! So far my eyes are the same color as always. Needless to say, when I ran out I went ahead and bought some. I wish I had before and after pictures to show how well this works. The only thing is that I leave my mascara on at night so it's on when I put the serum on so I don't think my lashes have gotten a lot thicker yet. I will start taking my mascara off every night before putting it on and see if this makes a difference to the thickness. I will update this at a later date to see if it helps. Either way I highly, highly recommend this. I am so glad I got the sample or else I would never have know this wonderful product was out there!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I started using Grande Lash about a year ago and have faithfully kept using it every night since. It took 2-3 months to start seeing results, but then it really started to work! My eyelashes have kind of reached their terminal length at this point, but I love the length and will keep using this product. I’m attaching some pics - the before/after collage has a picture from mid March 2020 and April 2021. There’s also another angle (Eyes closes) to better show how long the lashes are. The photo of me looking up is with cheap mascara.  As a side story, I hadn’t seen my parents for months last year because of the pandemic, so when I finally saw my mom again in July 2020, one of the first things she did was ask me if I was wearing false lashes.  SO: this works but it takes time! You’ll be using it for a bit and not seeing results and maybe getting discouraged but keep at it!!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",It’s great but I paid 65 on amazon for 2!!! Millimeters google it. It’s 31 on Walmart and 61 for double size of 4 millimeters
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","With GrandeLash, I saw a visible improvement in the length of my lash hairs in 6 weeks. A millimeter or two. Not mindblowing, but noticeable. Unfortunately, it's not the type of improvement that can be easily captured in a photo, or I'd have posted photos with this review. I took before/after photos and frankly they look about the same on my camera because I have such fine diameter lashes with invisible tips. But in real life, I can see improvement, and 1-2mm is pretty good. I think you just need appropriate expectations for things like this. Don't be blinded by all the dazzling photos of people who had extraordinary results, because you'll be disappointed. GrandeLash works almost as well as prescription Latisse, but not even Latisse works for everybody.  MY REPORT CARD WITH LASH TREATMENTS: I was on Latisse for months, and my doctor stated Latisse potentially makes lashes longer, but it can't generate new hair follicles. The hair follicles you're born with are the ones you have for your entire life. But it MIGHT be able to delay hairs falling out. Which might in turn allow the microscopic baby hairs to reach maturity alongside the well-established hairs, which in turn creates an illusion that you have more hair density, even if you don't really have more hairs.  In my case, Latisse gave me longer lashes that touched my sunglasses, but my lashes were so sparse that you could literally count them. It just looked like I had 10-15 long lash hairs. They didn't get denser or more luxurious. Plus, I basically was born with a bald lower lash line, and no amount of Latisse could help. Eventually I stopped Latisse, mostly due to the high pricetag, and tried castor oil instead, every night for a year. It didn't do anything for me. I think castor oil is mostly placebo effect, confirmation bias, and snake oil. Don't bother unless you specifically have brittle lashes that break off at the ends. (I don't have this issue, so castor oil did nothing for me.) People with flexible, normal lashes don't need castor oil.  Finally, I tried GrandeLash, and I'm happy with the results. For the first 5 weeks I saw nothing. Then there was a sudden jump at 6 weeks where growth took off. Suddenly the longest lashes were near my eyebrows. There was peachfuzz on my lower lash line (not real lashes per se, but better than before.) I think GrandeLash helps my lashes be the best they can naturally be by adding length and allowing the small hairs to mature alongside the longer hairs.  FYI- I used one dip per eye, even though the instructions say to use one dip for both upper lids. I did it with the understanding that 2 dips per day would deplete the tube faster than 3 months. The reason I chose to do one dip per eye is that I used that one dip to cover my a) upper lashline, b) lower lashline, and whatever was left over on the brush I wiped across my brow tails. If I had used one dip to cover BOTH eyes, I would always have felt that the side I started on got more liquid than the second eye. But that's just me.  ---------------12 week update-------------------- I have visibly longer lashes after a full 3 month course of GrandeLash. I saw my dentist yesterday after 3 months, and she was raving about how great my lashes look. So the change is noticeable to others, even if I still can't take a good photo of the results. You'll just have to take her word for it....!  The only minor downside is that some lashes are so long that they are starting to exhibit weird effects, such as curving downward at the tips (like an S bend instead of a C curve) . I think this might be due to uneven development in the hair follicle, or maybe when lashes get long enough they can develop a wave just like hair on your head. Who knows. It's a small price to pay overall, and probably fixable with a lash perm."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Ive been using this product for over a year...I LOVE IT!! My lashes are so long and have become darker...when I wear this with my good mascara, people always ask if I have falsies on-and I'm a blonde!!! Highly recommend, especially for us gals over 40 who need some thickness and length to our lashes..."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",This works very very well only problem is it can cause darkening of the iris & some other issues. It does make my eyelids a little dark the morning after but it fades once I stop the serum. I try to alternate it w/a lash serum w/o a prostaglandin in it. Pls check the side effects of this ingredient b4 buying a serum with it as an active ingredient!! Prostaglandins have serious side effects! Then decide if ur willing to risk this for longer lashes. I lost my lashes thanks to extensions. I don’t care what any lash artist says extensions will DESTROY ur lashes in due time if u wear them constantly! This serum saved my life! My lashes are now thicker & longer than ever but my green eyes are much darker /duller now bc of this serum but I knew the risks when I made this purchase & it doesn’t have as much as latisse.
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","The short review: This stuff works. However, it takes a couple of months of persistent daily use to see a change, and 3-4 months to see big lashes.  The long review: I'm a ginger kid with short, blonde lashes. I had lash extensions professionally done for about 7 years, but my person moved. I decided to try doing them myself with lash tabs, which worked well until I tried a different glue that caused a bad reaction. After that, my lashes were basically non-existant bc so many were broken or pulled out. I had too little lashes left to even use mascara at that point I decided to try Grande Lash. I read the directions and reviews and knew going into it that there would be no instant Gratification here.... but persistence paid off. The before and after picture shows my lashes after about 1 month of use, then again after about 3 months of use. (Also. My lashes were home-dyed in the after picture.) I'm at about month 4 now, and my lashes are continuing to improve!!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","For most of my adult life, I have had very short, thin lashes. In recent years they've been too sparse to even apply mascara. Have tried all sorts of lash serums that are supposed to make your lashes grow, but none of them worked. Worse, some had to be applied twice a day.  I actually did try Latisse once, but that was a huge waste because that product encloses about 60 separate little brushes. You're supposed to use a new brush every time you apply the product. Those dry brushes absorb too much of the product, so I ended up just putting the drop on my fingertip and applying to my lashes that way. Had to give away or throw out all the brushes. Worse, you have to get a prescription for Latisse, which is absolutely RIDICULOUS!!  To my great surprise, GrandeLash-MD actually worked! After about 6 weeks, I started notcing my lashes were a lot longer. This time they actually looked good with mascara applied. Plus the product is once-a-day application with the brush built right in (the way it SHOULD BE) and you don't have to go to all the expense and hassle of going to an eye doctor to get a prescription."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I've always had really long and thick eyelashes but about 10 years ago signed an eyelash and then with wear and tear from years of being a business professional and layering on mascara 24/7 began to see my eyelashes thin out. Been using this product for a year now, 3 nights a week and my eyelashes are back to what they were at their best.  The serum does take some getting use to because if you get it in your eyes it does burn a but initially. I have severe allergies which it has not made worse and blue eyes which it has not darkened."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","This stuff is a miracle product. I rarely write reviews but I really was compelled to because I LOVE this product. I started seeing results after two or three weeks but now, after consistently using it daily for three months I have eyelashes that look false ( or like extensions!) I am beyond pleased. My eyelashes used to be short, sparsen and I was missing lashes on each corner of the eye. Not only did it make them thicker, it made them grow back in the corners and they are SO long my son told me today I may have to cut them at some point because they are almost touching my eyebrows. Lol. I just thought I’d have to accept that I’d have shorter sparse lashes because I’m getting older, but I will never have to because I’ll never be without this stuff!! The trick is be patient, be consistent and make sure to cover the entire lash line. I sort of feather it on to the outer lashes too. It worked way beyond how I expected it to."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I honestly wasn’t expecting this. I was sick of using mascara, fake lashes give me unnecessary stress, & extensions are too expensive. My lashes have always been short & stubby so when i heard about Grandelash I was a bit skeptical at first but after only 5 weeks of using this serum I’m seeing great progress making me hopeful that I can have lashes that I don’t have to work for.  I didn’t even realize how much of a difference it made at first (I’m kind of impatient) but after a month of using it I’m seeing some amazing results. Can’t wait to see how they’ll look after 6 months!  I highly highly recommend this. ❤️"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I stopped getting eyelash extensions and was looking for something to help get my eyelashes back in good condition. I am so impressed with this lash serum! It’s really hard to get in a photo but my lashes are so much thicker and longer. I paired this with a lash tint mint, also on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/Godefroy-Professional-Natural-Black-Applications/dp/B000AS45KS/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=lash+tint&qid=1623249292&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=AJLB35BD2L83X&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE0N1c3SVcxQ0RDUlImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA5MzkyODIxQUFCWU1DUllWN0JCJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5MjgyNTExOERVV0dFT1QxREY0JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfcGhvbmVfc2VhcmNoX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) and I am not missing my lash extensions at all! I use this once daily at night before bed."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性"," Worth the money I promise you!!! If you are consistent with it, it works so fast."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I’ve used Latisse for 13 years. I was always scared to try something else. I finally stopped using latisse and as expected, my lashes became short and sparse and barely visible. I thought I would try this after hearing great things. This took longer than expected to show results for me. I think about 12 weeks...but wow! Never have I ever gotten results like these. The pic doesn’t do the results justice. My lashes nearly touch my brows. Never had that ever happened with latisse. Also, unlike latisse, this adds volume for me. I’ve been using this since July or august. I still see increased volume and growth with every passing week. Definitely worth it. Yes, it does sting at first, but your reaction will decrease and it’s totally tolerable, unless you’re especially sensitive. I order here and the grande lash site."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I’ve always had short lashes, no matter how much mascara I would use , or curl them, they were still short and not full. I started using this product since 2/14/2021 and my lashes are so long even without mascara and curl on their own. When I apply mascara they look fake! I absolutely recommend this product. Doesn’t irritate my eyes either. Great buy!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","So much better than I had thought. I really thought that nothing would work outside of a prescription or Latisse. Not the case. This actually really works well. So I purchased this in mid-April '18 and by mid-June I had noticeably longer lashes and by July I can honestly say my lashes are so long and pretty!!! So it takes a full cycle but it's so worth it if you have really short, stumpy lashes. Mine were both really short and very, very thin. Now, I don't think that it has made my lashes thicker per se but the added length and then adding mascara really makes them look lush. I'm sold! I will be buying this again and again. Other notes: I'm really bad at remembering to put in on every single day even though it states to apply once every day. I just forget - and still, it works! Lastly, when I accidentally over-apply it - it does bother my eyes just a little. It doesn't last long but if you are really sensitive and over-apply it might be troublesome. I RECOMMEND THIS 100%"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","In my youth I was blessed with full, thick lashes. In fact, I remember wearing my shades further down my nose, otherwise I couldn’t blink, bcuz they were so long. True story, don’t judge. Then At 52 yo I was noticing my lashes were starting to look very thin and lighter in color. My friend, who does lashes, eyebrows, etc., (as a professional) told me about this product. I did not want to “ have them done,” so she told me about this product. I posted these pics, no makeup or anything, and you can see how great it works. I wish I could say I was diligent about following directions, but that wouldn’t be true. Just passing this on to anybody that is looking for this type of great product- since there are so many out there. Another friend of mine used Latisse (sp?)) and it too worked well but she said, the minute I stopped using it, it was almost immediate she noticed they were going back to how they were before. I stopped using this over a month ago and plan to buy more just so I will have it if and when I may need it. Hope this review helps someone."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","This works and I can't believe it. I'm 53 and have done extensions but hate going to the appointments. Taught myself how to put on fake eyelashes during COVID but got kinda tired of doing it. I don't follow the instructions because working from home I don't have makeup on most of the time and sometimes I'm too tired to wash my face at night. I put in on whenever I wash my face and even before on put eye makeup on. Hard to get a good photo. Love having bottom lashes now and I think it looks funny having huge top lashes but I know its in style for the young ladies. I learned about Grande because I met a woman and couldn't believe how long her lashes were and she told me about Grande on Amazon. Have been using since September and I had tiny stub lashes. Now even when I don't have mascara on it kinda looks like I do. Buy it and be patient, it works, still can't believe it."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I would like to say I used it daily, which I did in the beginning, but then I would start to forget. So after a few weeks, I probably was remembering to use this product on my top lashes 3-4 times a week. After about two months suddenly I realized my top lashes were much longer than they had been and my bottom were longer too. Then a few weeks later, my top lashes are brushing up against my reading glasses! This past week, riding in the work elevator, a manager from a different department was commenting on how great my eyelashes work. I've had this product 2 1/2 months and only used it half of the time during the week and still I have gotten great results. This is a keeper product for me."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I used that popular MLM ""Booster of Lashes"" for a few years (with good results) before deciding the price was too frivolous. I took a chance on this one and at a fraction of the cost it's given me just as good lash & brow growth! I have the 3 month supply and started noticing the changes around 2 months.  Now definitely going to buy again, but deciding between the 3mo and 6mo sizes... My friend who previously sold me the other stuff believed that its effectiveness ran out somewhere around 4-5 months after opening the tube, and I assume the same logic applies here so I'm leaning toward another 3mo supply. The one downside with this size is that the smaller tube has a shorter brush/wand, making it a little harder to apply than if the wand was full size, but still manageable."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I was trying to wait for the recommended 3 month period to see full results before writing this review. But then I thought of all of the people hesitating to make the purchase because of doubts and I figured that I would write it now because there is no time to waste when you are going to get the results you are looking for! And, this product for sure delivers! I am your number one skeptic on just about everything, especially products that claim to defy or enhance nature. Grande Lash MD really, really grows your lashes and also thickens them. I saw improvements begin around the 3rd week! No exaggeration, I have not had my lashes look like this in 20 years,( unless I paid for them)! It is worth mentioning that ever since childbirth, I have had challenges with hair regrowth. A lot of women do. And my lashes were something that changed. I had zero confidence in any product working so I had them professionally done. Until Covid. I am so glad that I decided to try this product. I hope any of you experiencing thinning eye lashes will try it and have the same results! Now, let’s tackle those brows!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I started using GrandeLash as a last ditch effort after lash extensions left my eyelashes damaged, thinning, and stubby. After consistent use for 3 months, I am overwhelmingly pleased with the results. The formula did occasionally cause my eyes to be a bit itchy or dry but not too terribly (and I have super sensitive eyes and skin.) Overall I highly recommend this product!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I would give this more stars if I could! When I was about to run out of the other long-lash formula I used to use and I knew I had to go to a dermatologist to buy it (as I’ve been doing for years) and pay a lot more for it, I decided to check out Amazon in case there was an alternative. There were many!  I picked Grande and I’m so happy I did. It goes on perfectly with the brush that’s attached to the cap, I haven’t lost a single eyelash and it’s doing its other job: My lashes are staying longer than they would be without it.  The container is as pretty as you see here in the photos and I really like that it looks like it’s a tube of lipstick so I don’t have it hide it from my significant other: Why let him know my eyelashes are only this long because of Grande Cosmetics?!  One other thing: Because I'm a natural blonde, my eyebrows are too light so I brush the serum on them too. It makes them a little darker and more natural looking."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",I have tried 2 other lash serums with no luck. I got this hoping that third time would be the charm and HOORAY!!! This one really works. Pics are before after 8 weeks and after 12 weeks with mascara. I didn't have enough lashes to wear mascara for years. This is a miracle. I actually have my lashes touching my glasses they are so long now. I am recommending this to everyone I know. I keep whipping out my phone to show friend the before pics. Without mascara my new lashes are coming on black and a coworker thought I just started wearing makeup when all I was wearing was my new grown in lashes. Worth every penny.
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Works.  I noticed after about a month that I was losing less eyelashes. Now the ones I have are fuller, healthier and darker. These photos both have no makeup, although lighting is a bit different, you should get the idea. I also started a new skin regimen at the same time I bought the lash serum, also working well. Ha.  UPDATE: Was getting my eyebrows waxed and she commented, ""Your lashes are so pretty!"" So that was nice. It's December now, I've been using for 6 months, same tube. Hasn't run out yet because I've stopped using daily and just use when I remember for upkeep."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I was skeptical to use this product after a friend raved about it since my eyelashes were so damaged from having eyelash extensions for 8 months straight. COVID hit and I let my false eyelashes fall out on their own. I was in search of a product that would promote growth and thickness. I am so happy with the results! I applied the serum every night and after about two weeks, I could definitely see a difference. My eyelashes are noticeably longer now. Two of my friends recently asked me if they were extensions! I of course told them about this amazing product. Just be careful when applying at night not to get it in your eyes since they will burn a bit. I ordered a second tube of the serum, but I still have some left from the first bottle, which is meant to be a 3 month supply (it’s lasted a little longer). With the threat of COVID still present, I can’t see myself going back to eyelash extensions. I will continue using Grande eyelash serum instead. It’s safer and more cost effective!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I am 44 years old and have three young children and my once long eyelashes were starting to look pathetic. I bought this thinking that there was a chance I might have some results, but I had no idea how insanely incredible the results would actually be. The first month was frustrating because, despite applying it every night before bed, I saw no difference. But I kept on and now, three months later, my eyelashes are long and full and they look fake. They are so amazingly feathery. I will never stop using this product!!! #SuperFan"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","It really actually works! My lashes have always been so thin and short - within 2 months or so after using this product every day they are so much longer!!- I can’t believe it! I will get these mascara marks from the ends of my lashes hitting my upper eyelid -that has never ever happened in my life cuz my lashes were always way too short to ever reach!but OK Ya they did irritate my eyelids a bit at first for a few days but nothing too bad- I just kept using it everyday and it quickly went away. Pain is beauty anyways! and 100% worth that little bit of minor pain for the results!! I’ve never used any kind of beauty product that actually produces such great accurate results as the product claims, truly amazing!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I am genuinely shocked how well this works! I purchased after seeing several people on my Instagram share their success with this product. Although I did experience a little redness and irritation within the first week or two using the product, I contribute that to it changing how my eyelashes are growing!  My eyelashes before this product were starting to fall out and look thinner but after, they rarely fall out even if I have to rub my eyes, the length has been incredible! My fiancé even asked if I was trying fake lashes because they are so much longer than they used to be. I would recommend this product to anyone to at least try for a month!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I saw results within a week. I used R&F previously and it works just as well, but I’m not growing strange eyelashes in the inner corners of my eyes with this. It burns a little if you get too much on the brush. A little goes a long way. Update: This has lasted me a lot longer than 3 months. My eyelashes are super long, but not scraggly and uneven like with other serums. I actually don’t use it like I’m supposed to. I do it once a day in the mornings after showering, washing my face and moisturizing. I put my usual makeup on once I’m certain it’s dried."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I have been using this product for almost 3 month now. I have to say, my lashes have grown substantially. I was getting lash extensions for the past 6 years and finally had them taken off. My lashes were extremely short due to the extensions and I can tell my lashes have grown. I know it works differently for everyone so I have to say for myself, it has helped my lashes grown in length however not in thickness. Picture attached shows my lashes when I removed my lash extension(1) my lashes 2 months out with mascara(2) and last picture is today (3)."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","This product has been an all-star find! To start-- it works! My eyelashes are so long and healthy I have been mistaken for having false lashes or lash extensions on many times over since using this. It can have a slightly irritating affect and I say that only as a forewarning if you have sensitive skin. It may cause some reddening of the skin around your eye when you first use. That being said, it's not enough to cause concern at least from my viewpoint because you do get used to it after a few weeks and man oh man does it work! I now use it every other night. (I recommend using it nonstop for at least 30 days every night and then every other night to maintain. If you do stop using this product your eyelashes will shed eventually and maintain more of your usual length but if you keep using this in your routine even a few times a week your eyelashes will maintain their length!). Also, this bottle lasts me closer to 5-6 months. This is a new staple for me. *Note, The pictures included Are of a clean face ready for bed. I have my eyeliner tattooed."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Worth every penny!!! My lashes got demolished after fake eyelash extensions and I had no idea how to get my lashes back. Welll... my lashes are back and LONGER and THICKER than ever before. They are very blonde eyelashes so when I put mascara on, my lashes look better then when I had eyelash extensions. I'm so shocked and thrilled. Someone the other day asked me at the grocery store if I had eyelash extensions?!?!! Yep, buy this stuff. Its the best thing EVER if you want long eyelashes!!!!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I have been using this product for almost a year now after a server at a local restaurant told me that's why her lashes looked so amazing. A couple of things I have learned....1.) I hear reviews that say it ran out shortly after purchase. When you think the product has run out, shake the tube or tap it on your palm and you will get another month or so out of it. 2.) I noticed some regrowth of eyebrows but what I was more impressed with is how it maintained the brow hair I had. It stopped the thinning and hair that remained was thicker and healthier so they appeared fuller. Only wish I had started sooner. 3.) Works amazing on eye lashes. Thicker longer healthier lashes that so not fall out when curling, washing, or applying makeup. I have never received compliments on my lashes until now."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I really wanted this product to work, however after four days I had to stop using it because my eyelids were so itchy and irritated. It felt as if there were bits of sand in my eyes. I followed the directions and only used it at night. The first night I thought it was because I had applied the product too near my lashes, so the next night I made sure to put it near the lash line, but not touching the actual lashes. By day two my eyes were feeling scratchy but as I said, I so wanted this product to work I continued to use it. The evening of the fourth day (a Friday) my eyes were so red and swollen that I had to put cold compresses on my eyes just so that I could open them. If the urgent care clinic in our neighborhood had been open I would have gone there for treatment. Luckily I continued to use the cold compresses and by the next morning I could open my eyes, however I couldn't wear my contact lenses for three days until the inflammation had stopped. Of course this happened over the weekend and I didn't want to go to the ER and explain that I wanted long lashes etc..."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","This product is insane. I bought it after I saw my gfs lashes growing over the last 5 months. Her lashes are offensively thick and long and literally look fake. EVERY time we go out she gets complimented on her lashes because they are SO long and thick, She swore by this product and I tried it because I saw the results on her. Its only been a month and I can already see a huge difference in my lashes. Use it religiously every night and you won't regret it. 10/10 would recommend."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I don't even know how to begin this review. I have been using this product for a few days, and I already see a difference. I don't know how that is even possible. This is the 1st product I have even tried for my eyelashes. I have never had any eyelashes to begin with and I really just picked something to try that was in between price range. This product doesn't burn, or smell. I put it on at night and in the morning. And already see a significant difference in growth. I don't know if that has to do with me not ever using something before but it works."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",I’ve tried other serums before but didn’t seem to notice too much of a difference. This one started working after about a month. I’ve used it now for about 5 months (scaled it back to once or twice a week once it seemed to reach its peak like the instructions said). My lashes are fuller and MUCH longer. The tips of my lashes are blonde so it’s not as easy to tell how long they truly are in the after photo without mascara but there is still a clear difference. 10/10 and Highly recommend!!!
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Super easy to use and most importantly: it works! I’ve gotten so many compliments on my lashes since I started to use this, even when not wearing any mascara! It did cause a bit of redness when I first started, but it was very minor and went away after about a week to 10 days, as they say it will on the website. Now, no redness. Now that my eyelashes are fully grown in, I use it every other day to maintain so a 3 month supply lasts about 6 months. Recommended this to many friends who have had the same or similar results."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","GrandLASH-MD works. I found the key is to use it routinely and you will see your lashes grow longer over 3-4 weeks. Give it some time to work. I’ve always had good lashes but sometimes had to use an extender on them for that wow factor. My top lashes are so long now that I have to trim them sometimes or they brush against my sunglasses, which believe it or not; gets annoying. Now if I could get them to grow really think and fuller; bye-bye mascara. If I had just one wish; it would be for someone to come out with a formula specifically for the bottom lashes to make them grow super long and thick! Not supposed to use this formula on your bottom lashes. I admit I have tried using it a little bit on the lower lashes and they do grow a little bit but I worry why they do not recommend using it for that. Sorry I don’t have before and after pics but I am convinced and will buy another supply in 5-6 months."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","So yes, this stuff IS irritating to the eyes. It is a little itchy and sort of burns, so I put it on at night when it doesn’t really matter so much if my eyes are irritated. I put the serum on my lashes every night for one month from December to January this year, and they grew about 1/8”. Definitely noticeable. Since then, I put the serum on. 2-3x a week as I remember to, and my lashes have grown almost 1/4” — so much that I no longer need false lashes. I’ve switched from lengthening to volumizing mascara, and I keep getting compliments on my lashes.  Yes, it’s irritating to the eye, so use it at night.  This stuff WORKS, and at the low cost it’s definitely worth it to me. S"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I hope i had pictures to show the difference and how much they have grown. I really don't take the time to write reviews, but in the beginning I was very skeptical and I did wrote a review of this product saying that the product made my eyes red and kind of itchy, however and because using it at nights and sometimes during the day, I have notice a HUGE difference with my lashes, when I curled them before and apply mascara I was really thinking of start doing lash extensions (which I did years ago and I told myself never again just because I lost a lot of my own lashes), with this product I have found the solution, and I'm glad I tried it. Just be patient, I saw the difference around 4 weeks using it every night and sometimes during the day. Hope this works for you :)"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I bought another highly reviewed lash serum off Amazon, but found out the company sends you a free bottle if you give a 5 star review. Tons of fake photos of people with extensions claiming that the product really worked. I was disheartened. I finally saw this product recommended and checked out the photos and reviews, and they all seem like actual results! Well, I'm here to say that I started using this in 2020 after one year I have seen amazing results. I do one swipe on one eye, dip again and do the same on the other eye. I've always had thin lashes and brows, so this is exciting for me:). I get compliments all the time and recommend this to family and friends. The only con is that my lashes are so long, they hit my sunglasses! It's an okay problem to have:)"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I purchased this already thinking it wasn't going to work, but I was looking for a less pricey alternative to my eyelash extensions that I have to get touched up every 2 weeks. I apply it at night after showering right over the extensions. Easy to swipe on and takes less than a minute. By the time my eyelashes extensions need touching up, most of them have fallen out so it made it easier to see my real lashes. Today is day 91 of using this product, minus 3 or 4 days that missed. I felt there was no change in the thickness, but they were maybe slightly longer. I decided that this product was not worth the cost and was ready to give up on it. BUT, when I went to get my extensions touched up, the gal that I always go to asked if I was using any product because my lashes looked thicker and longer! So I guess it does work, but I'm not giving up my extensions just yet. Maybe if I use it every day for another few month they will continue to get thicker and longer."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","After seeing this numerous times on Instagram, I finally caved and bought a trial size. After using it for a few weeks, I couldn't believe the difference in my eye lashes. They were longer & fuller. I could barely see them before, even with mascara. Now you can really see a difference without mascara and an even bigger one with it! I just bought this full size tube because I am definitely a lifetime user now!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",The difference between the two pictures above is after about 5 months of using the product off and on. I actually have problems with my lashes getting tangled now because they’re so long and thick. 10/10 recommend!! It took about 12 week for results to really start showing but it is definitely worth the purchase. The first 12 weeks I was really consistent with use (one bottle lasted me the 12 weeks). After the first 12 weeks I use the product a few times a week but it continues to make my lashes thicker
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I used to spend a significant amount of money on eyelash extensions that would last only 2-3 weeks at a time. You can imagine how expensive that would get. One day, I decided I didn't want to pay for lash extensions anymore or even invest the 1-2 hours of time it would take to get a replacement or fill; I didn't even want to pay to get my current extensions removed (big mistake). I ended up losing a majority of my natural lashes by letting the weight of the old, overgrown extensions let my naturals get frail and weak. Before I knew it, my lashes were sparse. Not even extensions would fix my problem. My lash tech then refered me to grandeLASH-MD and stressed that I need to be CONSISTENT with applying the serum and PATIENT for the solution to encourage results with my newly growing eye-fans. It takes about 8 weeks for a lash to shed and regrow. The most crutial time for strength and the volume of the serum to show is when the new eye-lash begins it's process of growth. I've been using this product for about a year now and I refuse to go back to lash extensions. It's cheaper paying $65/3 months versus $65-120/2 weeks. Plus I don't have to lay down for 1-2 hours. I just quickly apply it as a part of my night routine. Easy. Worth it."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I cannot believe this actually worked. I’ve used other products and have never seen results until I used this. I stopped using it after a month because of how much they actually grew!! My eyelashes are blonde, so until I curl and use mascara (which I only use one layer just to give them color) they look unbelievable and I get compliments all the time. I used to have to clump tons of mascara just to get this length but now they look so natural with a hint of mascara! I legit am so happy about this. I was even considering getting my eyelashes done with extensions and I am so happy I don’t have to go that route...GET THIS."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Let me start off by saying that I'm in my mid-60s. I've noticed over the years that my normally long and thick eyelashes (and eyebrows) had gotten pretty sparse. That's a normal part of aging. When I saw GrandeLASH MD, I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't take long before I started noticing results. After a few months, I think my lashes are back to what they were when I was younger. That being said, I don't know that everyone will have the same results. If you've always had short lashes, I don't know that this product will give you long lashes. I believe it will only give you what you were born with. I'm very happy with this product as well as the GrandeBROW."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I have used Grande cosmetics Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD - 3 Month Supply, for about thirteen weeks. The results are amazing. I have noticed a significant change in the thickness and especially the length of my eyelashes. My husband and daughters have complimented me on my long thick eyelashes. Even casual observers comment about my long, beautiful eyelashes. This has never happened until I began using this product. I am very happy and fully satisfied. I highly recommend its use. Thank you GrandelSASH-MD for this marvelous product!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I was dubious about actually seeing longer lashes but I am happy to report that this product delivered. I am in my mid sixties with my lashes having become thin and stubby and false eyelashes had no appeal. I have been using this product for six weeks and began seeing results after about three. I don't even use the product everyday, perhaps three or four times a week. Even the very sparse lashes on the outer bottom lid are beginning to fill in. It is easy to apply and once dry makeup can even be worn along with it. I have no way to compare value as this is the only lash growth product I have used but for me it was money well spent."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Can't believe that this actually works! I was a big skeptic but decided to try it because of my niece's recommendation. PLEASE check out my before and after photos! These pictures are taken about 12 weeks apart. At first, I thought that there was no change but after about four weeks, I started to see a difference and then my lashes REALLY started to thicken and lengthen! I LOVE this product!!!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I’m a huge skeptic about stuff like this. Like suuuuuuure my hair will grow or my bald spots will be gone yadda yadda. Well, my eyelash extension girl recommended this to me and I’m blown away. I swipe it on both my top and bottom lash lines every night before bed and my lashes have probably doubled in length. My lashes have always been short and poke straight out (hence why I get eyelash extensions) and the top lashes are almost as long as my extensions - not even joking. My bottom lashes almost look too awkwardly long when I put mascara on them. I never understood how this kind of stuff worked by my eyelash girl explained that this stuff stunts the natural shedding of your eyelashes so they hang on longer while they grow and hence end up being longer than they originally would have been before they naturally fell out. I’ll be buying this stuff for literally the rest of my life, I’m so happy not to have short, stubby lashes."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","This stuff is amazing!! It took a solid two months to notice results, but from that point on, I've been so impressed with this product. I had a patch where all of my eyelashes had fallen out, and this is completely filled in. My lashes, overall, are noticeably longer & fuller. With my regular mascara on, they look fake in the best way possible. I'm bummed I didn't take a before pic.  Absolutely love this product, and can't recommend it enough."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","It says to wait 3 months to see full results, and I'm still 3 weeks away from that,... But holy wow, the difference is incredible. I am SO glad I got this!  One swipe on each lid at night before bedtime at the same time I moisturize is so easy to do. I dabbed what was left on the brush in my little eyebrow bald spots for about a month and they filled in too!  My lashes are strawberry blonde so mascara is needed to even see them. I did 2 coats of the same mascara in both pics."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",I was hesitant to buy this product because if it's price but I finally decided to try it and I love it! I used false lashes for a while which caused my own lashes to fall out. I had a little bald spot from where I pulled my natural lashes off while trying to remove my falsies. This lash growth serum works! I've been using it for about 3 weeks religiously and I see results already! Will jeep buying for sure. I wasn't able to curl my lashes before because they were too short for my lash curler but that issue is long gone:)!
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I definitely saw growth in my eyelashes once I began using this product. However, I did notice my eyelids were discolored around where the serum went. Once I stopped using the serum the discoloration did fade. So I still use the serum but I don’t continuously use it as to minimize the discoloration that comes from it. I have brown eyes so can’t opine on Iris color change but would recommend it for those with dark brown eyes."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I saw a lady with the longest eyelashes ever and she told me she used this brand twice a day. Since then I started using it, I have to apply a small amount as it does irritate your eyes, so you have to be careful with how much product you add. But I fully recommend it, I have been using this for more than a year. I have always struggles with my eyelashes as I have been burned by a Roman candle on my eye (but Ed my eyelashes) had them ripped off while playing volleyball, so I just always struggled with my eyelashes. Now I take care of them and using this product has lengthened my eyelashes a whole bunch. I do notice though if I stop using it they start falling (naturally not because of the product) and they grow short. So you must keep using it which sucks, but I say the price is worth it and I will keep using this product because it just makes my eyelashes long and healthy"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I've lost hair (eyebrows, lashes thinning, crown hair) due to illness, medicines, thyroid and, well, just age. I miss those long lashes I had so started looking for something to help. Having tried several products, I can say that Grande Lash-MD is everything it touts to be, and more! Super easy to use but be patient as it takes a few weeks to a month to start seeing results. My lashes are so long now they touch my eyebrows when I wear mascara! In fact, they grew so well that I now only use it about once every three days. I don't even think about wearing false eye lashes. WHy when my own lashes are so incredible? Yes, a bit pricey but it also depends on what you are spending your money on. Cheaper than buying false lashes. And for some people, totally worth it. I'm one of them."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",This lash serum is a GAME CHANGER. The photo attached shows the day before I started using the serum (top photo) and 8 weeks later (bottom photo). It was recommended by my eyebrow/lash girl back in November. I purchased it the same day and have applied it nightly ever since! My lashes are tinted and have a lash lift in each photo but the new picture appears much thicker and my lashes have definitely lengthened. During the 8 weeks I also chose to let my lashes breathe and only applied mascara once or twice (I used to wear mascara daily). I definitely think the serum in conjunction with the lighter makeup routine was a big help! Looking forward to seeing how they look in the upcoming weeks.
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",I’ve used RevitaLaah before and was pretty disappointed so I had low expectations for this product but I was beyond impressed. With consistency and persistency this product will work. Forget about it and don’t expect anything for about the first month. Definitely take photos and compare it about two months later and you will see a significant different in length and volume. Naturally blessed with short Asian lashes and this product definitely helped grow it a bit. It’s certainly no lash extension but it does it’s job. Will continue to purchase on Amazon.
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I finally just got to reading the reviews after going through a whole 4-6week tube which lasted from December 13th 2021 to January 28th 2022. I am SOOO glad I didn’t read the reviews before buying this product because it would have scared me into not buying it. But let me tell ya I have been having amazing results and absolutely cannot wait to see what my lashes look like after 3 months of use!! I haven’t had any irritation or a bad reaction and I have very sensitive skin. It does sting if it gets in your eyes and the only thing I’ve noticed is a very small amount of discoloration on my lash line. Other then that, I will be watching close to make sure I’m getting the real tube and not a fake one because I’m a bit paranoid about that now!! This stuff has also forced me to have a good skin care routine because I get soooo excited to put it on every night before bed because of the results I’m having!  Note: I have always had fullish/longish healthy lashes. But my lashes have NEVER looked this good !"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性", It works! I have mascara on over this but overall happy with the length of my lashes!
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I was looking at purchasing the Rodan Fields lash boost but I thought I would give this a try before spending that big chunk of change AND I AM GLAD I DID. I started with the smallest bottle and saw growth after a few weeks, the next tube I ordered was much larger. I use morning and night and see a huge difference."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Love this!! When I ordered this product for first time, it was going to be my last time trying products like this. I've tried several other products in the past and felt ripped off and frustrated. I've been using this product for several months. I noticed my lashes growing, and they also appeared a bit thicker within a few (2-3) weeks. When I put my mascara on, it really enhances the length and fullness big time. As long as the price remains reasonable, I will continue to order it. I liked it so much, I bought some for my adult daughter. She too has noticed lash growth and is happy with this product."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","If you’re looking for a sign to buy this, HERE IT IS!! BUY IT BUY IT!! You won’t regret it.  Key notes: *yes, it stung a little for the first 4-5 applications and made my eyelids pink. But that did go away! *took about 6 weeks before <noticeable> results. And then BOOM. Lashes were so long and lush. (I had extensions in for 3 months and when I took them off they were very short and thin.) *it says to do it at night but I did it before I put on make up for the day too"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","To preface, I’ve always had healthy eyelashes. I got this on a whim to see if I could get my eyelashes to a point where I could wear less mascara with the same impact. Well, since using this product, I have noticed a significant impact on my “naked” lashes. They’re thicker, longer, and fan out beautifully. Quite literally every time I’ve put on mascara (about once every week) I am asked where I get my lash extensions done and am met with absolute shock when I tell people these are my eyelashes. I have been applying it religiously every morning after washing my face or showering. Looks like I’ll be using it for the rest of my life."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","So I used to do extensions and those were a pain in the ass, either you have to continuously have them done or deal with patchy ugly eyelashes until they grew back. The glue-on ones are gross, they're ugly, we can tell they're fake and dirty, just stop. I don't know if it's hormones that made my eyelashes sparse but I searched around after I couldn't get my cheap from Mexico Latisse. Gave this stuff a try and am sooo happy, I still have the first bottle I bought back in Feb, so 4 months and still going. At first, my eyes were a little sensitive but beauty is pain, jk, it wasn't that bad. After about 2 weeks I noticed a difference and after a month I couldn't believe this stuff was so good. I should have taken pics but trust me, I've told my friends to buy this cause natural looks sooo much less trashy hookerish."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I spend $60 every three months for two tubes of mascara that I wardrobe on my lashes (one to separate and lengthen and the other to make look thicker). I’ve also spent hundreds of dollars on getting my lashes done, but it’s too high maintenance and even starts looking too fake if I go past a week to get it redone.  I asked a friend what mascara she uses because her lashes were so long and thick. She said it’s not because of her mascara, it’s long and thick because of GrandeLASH, so I bought some not expecting much because other brands were a disappointment.  I started noticing a huge difference within a few weeks!! I don’t use as much mascara, and I don’t have to worry about getting my lashes done!! So I’m saving so much just by using this because a little goes a long way!!  I also started using it on my eyebrows because I have to fill it in with a brow pencil since my eyebrows are so thin and sparse. This even works for my eyebrows looking fuller!!!  The only bad thing is that once you stop using it, like anything else, it will stop working. But if you are consistent with applying, and can invest in this instead of mascara or false lashes, this is so worth the money!!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Got this for Christmas. It’s Feb so about two months of using this at night, my lashes are getting redic! I put mascara on for the first time in weeks and they touch my eyebrows and project so much farther than before. Will buy again. Worth the $"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",This product has made an amazing transformation in my lashes! They are thicker and longer. My friends actually pulled on my eyelashes because they didn’t believe that I didn’t have strip lashes on. I had a couple of days of slight irritation. It was less irritation than other brands I’ve used so I decided to power through. I’m so glad I did because within a month I started seeing a slight change. At six weeks there was a big change and at two months my eyelashes looked completely different. I wish I took before and after pictures because the growth/thickness of my lashes is noticeable even without mascara.
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I accidentally ripped out all of my upper lashes when my eyelash curler broke. It was a freak accident and I was devastated. I had lost 95% of my upper lashes on my left eye. I searched the internet for something, anything that could possibly help me get them back faster. PLEASE LISTEN!: THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!!! I am happy to report that not only did they grow back but I saw amazing results within 30 days! I'm not sure if this is typical but for me this formula was a miracle. I was worried that I was going to spend all this money on something that won't help but it was worthy every dollar I spent. I can't even believe it. It worked so well. My eyelashes actually grew back longer and thicker. I felt that I needed to write a review because I want someone else in my position to know that they can trust this product and it WILL HELP THEM! Happy happy..,"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Makes me look like I have Disney Princess eyes... I sweat for a living, so mascara and extensions are tough for me... this makes me feel like no makeup necessary, so it’s extremely liberating to wake up with just, like - more beautiful eyes somehow!? Word to the wise: commit to the regime. Give it a few months to kick in. It stung at first, but then I stopped applying it quite so close to the inner eye - just apply along the lash line. No more stinging after a few days, and my hazel eyes are as green/hazel as ever - knock on wood! However - with the lash enhancement, even if my irises did darken, it might actually be worth it bc it’s like eyelash extensions without that level of time, money, or the fakiness look - I FEEL like they are natural, even though I get help with growing them... it’s like a great fertilizer for the lashes!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","The photo with the green dot between my brows is a pic from December 15th.  The other photo is exactly 2 months later.  Clearly it's grown and I'm very happy. I've had a couple of days where my lids were irritated but nothing I couldn't solve with a splash of cold water later in the day.  I have discolored eyelids and undereyes naturally, not from the product so don't mind that in the photo.  I'm going to continue using it (I purchased the 3 month supply and have 1 month left)  Will be reordering. Very happy 😊"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","It really did work on me!! Also, as an added bonus, I no longer have hooded lid eyes. I guess that's a side effect, less eye fat. So crazy, but I look way different in a good way! Even my boyfriend noticed and he never notices anything haha I have sensitive skin and it didn't irritate me."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","Got this on Prime Day. I used this in the past and I had to STOP using it because it worked so well. My lashes were constantly hitting my glasses. After some time I concluded- small price to pay for lashes, right? And much more affordable than fake lashes (which I’ve never done). Great deal on Prime day! $45 when I paid $65 in the past. My only issue is that I didn’t buy more! What was I thinking? Superb product!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I’ve used both LiLash and RevitaLash before and this does just as good as a job at a fraction of the cost. I give it 4 stars only because I haven’t discontinued using it and usually with eyelash serums the minute you stop using your eyelashes shrivel back to the way they were before or worse. Enjoying the product and one tube is gonna last a very long time. Definitely worth it.  UPDATE: after about 2+ months of using as directed my eyelashes are ON CRACK. I am super satisfied. The trick, I know, is to not stop using this product or your lashes will shrivel. Buy and don’t knock it until you’ve been using it for 2-3 months as directed."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I’ve been using this off and on for about 6 weeks and I truly think it works. I used it religiously the first 2-3 weeks. Every day once then fell off to maybe 4-5 times a week. I noticed right at the 4th week I actually had some crazy lashes growing in. A couple grew straight out and refused to curl they were so strong and long!  Recently I stopped getting lash extensions due to a sensitivity to the adhesive so of course my natural lashes needed a boost. Normally I have long thick lashes but this definitely gave them a boost. I think this product definitely enhances what you already have. If you don’t normally grow in thick, long lashes, I don’t think this is a miracle cure for you. But if you want to just give them a little shot of life I think this works with patience.  I did have a small sensitivity to this product when using at night at the beginning. I don’t know if it was getting in my eyes overnight or in the morning in the shower so I started applying in the AM so it could fully soak in. I’ve had no issues when using it in the morning before I apply makeup. I let it dry while I finish my routine then makeup- which isn’t much at all. But I’ve had no reaction since."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","This is my second bottle to purchase and I love this product and recommend it to all of my friends. The size that said it will last 3 months, definitely lasts longer than 3 months. I am still on my first bottle 6 months later. Granted I have not used it every single day, but have used it pretty consistently and will keep using until there is no more product left. I do suggest swiping it slightly above your top lash line, as the product will slide down and if you get it too close to your eye, it can travel into your eye (but it does not sting.) I had almost no lashes and this product gave me super long lashes and even filled out my lash line a little better. The mini size would make a great gift for someone!"
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I don't usually write about anything even if I like it. But, I am amazed by this product. I had read all the reviews good and bad and was skeptical. But a friend recommended it and her lashes are amazing. So I tried it. In the beginning i did not use every day. But in the last 2 months I did and the results are amazing. My lashes are longer and thicker even without mascara. I Love what it has done to my lashes. This can sting the eye if it get into it but otherwise no irritation."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","This stuff actually works. I don’t know what happened to the people leaving the reviews saying it’s a fake, but I’ve purchased 2 of the smaller size (which lasted way longer than 6 weeks for me) and it’s working amazingly. The photos I attached are exactly 3 months progress. I did have some irritation and super itchy eyelids at first, but a friend told me to buy ocusoft eyelid wipes and use those before applying the serum, and it completely cleared up the irritation. I haven’t had any iris or skin darkening and I’m still using daily. You do have to be consistent and patient to see results, but it’s worth it. I use it in the morning because I do my skincare more reliably than before bed. I wash my face, wipe both lids with an ocusoft wipe, let dry, apply serum, then give it a few minutes to dry before continuing my skincare routine. I also got the grande lash conditioning serum and it makes my lashes darker and they’re growing in a more uniform pattern now after about 2 weeks of use. Definitely worth the money, especially if you’re getting lash extensions regularly."
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性",This is after using for 3 months. I started noticing grow around week 3 of using it. My lashes are incredibly long now. I haven’t experienced any loss of volume as some reviewers shared experiences of. People always think I have eyelash extensions and I always say it’s this product! I put on a coat of mascara to make my lashes dark so you could see them in the photo. I’m considering buying their hair product next.
"Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD 睫毛增强精华,促进睫毛更长、更浓密,无刺激性","I didn't photograph my before use and after use, but this stuff works! Within about two or three weeks I noticed my lashes are longer and seem to be growing faster. It does make my eyelids (top and bottom) a little pink with irritation the next morning, but it doesn't burn or itch. I love this stuff! And the brow serum is just as great. I just wish these items were a bit cheaper, and you can't see inside the tube to see how much is left, or even how much was there to begin with. It feels like it runs out sooner than they claim."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),Nikkia Joy on YouTube had talked about this brand of Mascara and since it's so freaking cheap I threw caution to the wind and decided to try it. I'm tired of looking like a sad raccoon while wearing Mascara in the jungle known as Florida. My other options are false lashes and ain't nobody got time for that! Plus it's a little embarrassing when you're sitting at dinner with a bunch of adults and one of your eye lashes decides to jump onto the table. Last option is looking like a zombie with no lashes.  But I've worn this Mascara a few times now and it's amazing!! Just look at my before-zombie pic to my after-alive pic. My eyes are sensitive and this doesn't bother them. I have a teenie bit of flaking but I have HORRIBLE habits. I rub my eyes all the time. So if you are an actual grown up and leave your face alone I think you'll be good. It's actually difficult to remove which is a good thing in my book. I use some oil and that works great. Just don't expect water to remove this stuff. I mean it's actually waterPROOF.  Yes I recommend this.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I have used the same mascara for about 20 years. Maybelline Falsies is my go-to. Hands down, my jam. Mascara is my thing. Even after I wash my face and shower at night, I apply just a little bit before bed. Why you ask…. Because I am NOT going to be on the morning news after the Nader 🌪 blew through reporting what I seen with naked eyes! In fact, if I’m in the shower when Gabriel blows his trumpet, I’m gonna need them to give me about 10 extra seconds to grab that wand because I ain’t walking through the pearly gates looking like a bug-eyed booger bear. I’ve tried Younique, MAC, Urban Decay, Two Faced, Benefit, Avon, Thrive, L’Oréal, Covergirl, you name it. Small fortune! I always go back to Falsies because the others don’t lengthen as much or they irritate my eyes. My eyes pour tears and burn so bad so easily! It’s like they can sense a scent or something in the mascara - even the sensitive kind! So for several reasons, Falsies has been my bestie for about two decades.  So I’m a member of this Facebook bargain shopping group. A mascara was posted as a daily deal and labeled “a group favorite.” I decided to try it and get my usual “waterproof blackest black” selection. Man!!! I am a fan! This Essence mascara, first of all, has not irritated my eyes one bit in 3 days. Also, this is ONE coat. Read that again ONE COAT! I am usually a 2 coat minimum and 3 coat special occasion kinda gal with an occasional 5 second hit of the blow dryer for an even more dramatic lash at times - “the bigger the bow, the higher the hair, the longer the lash, the better the mama”…. 😉 Anyway, I won’t give up totally on my tried and true Falsies, but this is my new go-to for now. And for $4.99 a tube, no irritation, and this kind of one-coat amazingness, they have won me over!!!! (Naked eyes for reference and better stare at it good, because you won’t see it again! Ever.)"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"LOVE this mascara! (Btw my pic is with just one coat on, could get more length with more layers) Animal-friendly, cheap, great quality... Feels soft when dry, unlike all other mascaras I've used and smells nice, both probably because of the beeswax 🐝 Splashed water in my face (facewash commercial style) and scrubbed at my eyes to test waterproof, and while a few dirt sized specks came loose, they wiped off my face and no smearing. It washed off easier than other waterproof mascaras. I was nervous about clumping after looking at other photo reviews but I had no problem and that was after it had been outside in a cold mailbox for a few hours. Overall 10/10, I found my new fav mascara."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I LOVE THIS MASCARA!! It has been Louisiana Hot, Humid weather tested and did not wind up with racoon eyes! I bought the waterproof version and am very pleased with it! I just bought some for my best friend, who is a dirt racer, to wear when she races! This came in a sealed plastic overlay. It was easy to remove with a facial wipe. So after previously spending big bucks on the ""fancy big name brands"", I found this gem and am very happy with it."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"When I first got this mascara, it was and instant favorite. Love the length and volume both, and best of all, my lashes didn't feel stiff or sticky (feels a lot like Mabelline's Full & Soft, if you've ever tried it, but with more volume). And it wasn't flaky by the end of the day like Full&Soft is. But after just 1-2 weeks, it now looks like spider eyes when applied in the morning, and is flaky all day. Maybe I got and older tube that was near end-of-life? Who knows. But as a contact wearer, flakes are baaaaad, so I'm hesitant to try again."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"After staring at a friend’s lashes obsessively I finally asked what she was using that was different and it was this mascara! I won’t lie, I do have good lashes, but couldn’t believe how well this went on, no burning when I got close to the water line and after just one coat I was already sending pictures to friends to recommend this mascara! I didn’t use a primer and this honestly compared to a chanel mascara I paid over $30 for but this one is vegan and cruelty free! If you are curious definitely try it! Having my new go to mascara, cruelty free and at this price point... done and done!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),Love this product! It stays on all day! Make sure you get the waterproof one. I've used so many different kinds it's ridiculous. From very expensive to cheap and this is my forever favorite! Yes the look is over. It not only stays on but my lashes are longer and no smudges throughout my day. I was out in the 100 degree hot sun and it stayed on without primer. Thank you! My search is over. Yes! Buy this and the price is perfect for such excellent quality!
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I have tried every single hypoallergenic mascara on the market - from the super expensive to the cheapy ones & every single one I have had to remove within an hour of wearing because my eyes itch so badly I want to rip my eyeballs out (seriously had to carry Clear eyes eye drops bc it was so bad!) So when a friend recommended this brand to me I was reluctant to waste more money...OMG it has been the best makeup purchase I have ever made - I can wear this mascara all day without itchy eyes, it does begin to smear by the end of a super long day or if your AC at work breaks down and you're sweating... also it is easy to remove. I swear I am never buying another brand of mascara ever again!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I wore this for the first time yesterday for a date night. I had heard about this mascara and how people love it. I had been thinking about buying it but just wasn't sure until I read a review board on top mascaras. This was actually on the list so I thought I'd give it a try and retire my Loreal mascara which cost almost twice as much as this mascara. I really am impressed. I have short straight lashes and use a lash curler. This mascara kept them curled and didn't straighten them out like some mascaras do. It gave them uplift and length, no clumps. I only use waterproof and this holds up but wasn't hard to remove. I guess it depends on how heavy you wear your mascara. I go light on the makeup in general. I prefer the natural look, only use to enhance, not change myself. I would definitely recommend. Ordered and delivered the very next day. Plus I had Amazon credit so it was a happy purchase for me."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I have always been on the hunt for the ""perfect"" mascara......I have long, super thin, hardly pigmented lashes that no one can see if I don't wear mascara. I don't want a mascara to flake, smudge, or clump but want it to evenly coat and separate the lashes, provide additional length, and pile on lots of volume.  Princess Lash was everywhere.... Instagram, YouTube, Facebook. For the price point I figured it couldn't hurt to try it.... I've embarrassingly spent way more on tubes of mascara in the past.  Reviews tended to favor the regular formula over the waterproof but I like to purchase waterproof because of the humidity and allergens where I live.  First impressions were good but not great. The formula seemed a little bit too heavy on the bristles and I felt I had to comb it through quite a bit to even it out. By the end of the day I did have some flakes under my eyes but the formula did not way down my lashes and the lashes looked pretty good.  Fast forward a few uses and the formula has settled into the perfect consistency for my lashes. Because the bristles are firm but flexible and there are so many of them, they evenly separate my lashes and completely coat them in one application. I saved the ""perfect mascara wand"" from a drugstore brand, cleaned it, and have always had to use it to separate my lashes after applying any mascara but no longer. Today I decided to apply a second coat simply because old habits are hard to break and I had absolutely no need for the old faithful wand as there were no clumps and the separation was exactly what I wanted.  Princess Lash waterproof is easy to remove (I double cleanse starting with DHC's cleansing oil followed by Dr. Bronner's Castile soap). I haven't had any loss of lashes which sometimes happens with really strong waterproof formulas or leftover residue after washing.  When this tube has run its course I'll try the regular formula, as others stated they didn't see flakes with it. The flakes I see with the waterproof formula aren't excessive but if they could be reduced, I wouldn't mind.  Overall, I am extremely happy with Princess Lash mascara and won't be going back to overpriced tubes."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"The price is great, the packaging is adorable, the mascara did wonders to my non-existent eyelashes LOL I did one coat and I couldn't believe how well it went on and the difference my eyelashes look from after application from what they look like for years. I haven't ever been able to get a mascara that I thought was this good and this is pretty inexpensive. I ended up putting on a second coat and wow I am super impressed. I just started working for a funeral home I start in a few days so I'll really get to put to the test how waterproof this stuff is and I will update my post once I know."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This mascara is pretty amazing! I have blond eyelashes, so I have tried many different mascaras over the years. My daughter is half Chinese (I am half Swedish), and with a mild epicanthal fold, and short, slanted lashes, it is hard to see her lashes with most mascaras. She put on one coat of this and WOW!, what a difference! I had gotten into the habit of using a lash primer (Dior), and then mascara, but with this mascara, I don’t think I need the primer! My only complaint is that for a waterproof mascara, it does smudge. I am on call a lot, and have to sleep when I can and get woken up a lot. This stuff definitely smudges after about an hour of sleeping. Since I don’t usually have time to wash away under-eye circles when I am awoken, I don’t think I will be wearing this to work. But for a night out, or even just daytime use, this stuff is amazing! (My all-time favorite, no-smudge mascara that doesn’t budge at all at work is Bobbie Brown’s No Smudge mascara. I isn’t going anywhere!, even with contact lenses!)"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I attached pics of makeup I’ve done on people to try to show their lashes with this mascara and cropped a picture of myself in the last photo to show it! I constantly am being asked if I have false lashes on or eye lash extensions and it’s literally just this mascara! I used to swear by the falsies mascara by maybelline and this mascara blows it out of the water! I am a forever buyer of this mascara! It is harder to get off since it’s the waterproof one that I use, but I use a micellar water makeup remover that works wonders to remove this waterproof mascara. Don’t hesitate, BUY THIS MASCARA! I promise you won’t regret it."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I will admit from the get go that I have naturally long lashes so I honestly wasn’t expecting a whole lot from this but I couldn’t resist the hype around this mascara. Due to the price I figured what the hay and bought it and I’m glad I did. This mascara absolutely lengthens your lashes like you wouldn’t believe. You can literally see it happening as you apply the product. I had nice full lashes before but now fake lashes people wear got nothing on this!  The only cons I’ve found are that it does tend to clump if you’re not careful so using a separating comb is essential and also, it IS hard to get it all off at once. On the downside this means black smudges under your eyes that you have to keep attacking. On the upside, after you kill the smudges and wake up in the morning your lashes still have a pretty effect to them. Kind of worth it honestly."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This review is for the waterproof mascara. I have used this product twice and so far I really like it! This formula is perfectly thick and one coat is enough to coat your top AND bottom lashes. The wand does not pick up a lot of excess product but I do recommend wiping off as much product as possible since it is so easy to clump with even one coat. Even though it is so thick it does not feel heavy, itchy or wet, it dries up super fast so be quick with your application. I got some on my lids and it was easily cleaned with a wet Q-tip right after. You definitely cannot build this mascara so I couldn't build length or much of a curl- to me this does not add as much length as I'd like but it does add volume and definition which gives it the falsie look for sure. The biggest con is that it flakes A LOT, in my pictures it was already flaking right after applying it I can see this giving the raccoon eye look. Even though it flakes so much this mascara does not move so the flakes don't melt you can just brush them off. I wore it to a swap meet all day and it was raining and really humid, I took a tiny nap and it stayed on for over 12 hours and looked as good as when I first put it on. To remove it I used coconut oil to break it down, wiped with a makeup removing wipe pretty well but when I came out of the shower there was still a little bit of raccoon eyes. But I wiped that away and it was clean-definitely some work to remove but if you use an oil and makeup remover and then wash you will be fine. I gave it a 3 because the flaking and not being able to build is unfortunate, however I have to admit that I love the dramatic look it gives and for this price this mascara is awesome. The tube is a good size and seems to have a decent amount of product for $5 this is a pretty great mascara. I want to try the regular (not waterproof) to see if that flakes less so far I am happy with this purchase and will definitely be ordering more."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),I've used high end mascara and they don't make my lashes look as good as this mascara! Also I've cried with this on and they are really really waterproof so dont worry!
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Not a fan of waterproof mascara as a rule, but blistering heat & suffocating humidity make it impossible to avoid in summer. Hard on lashes, and most are just waterproof-ish at best. But this stuff is every bit as hardcore water-, sweat-, and smudge-proof as my other go-to, L'Oreal Voluminous. Also harder to remove. MUCH harder. Even my trusty Almay Eye MU remover that has never once failed me can't get it all off. Nor jojoba oil, cleansing balm, or my assortment of mu removing cleansers. Still on the hunt for a remover that can actually remove it. Otherwise a very good mascara that doesn't flake off like the non-waterproof version."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is the best mascara ever. I have used Tarte, IT, or Bare Minerals for years but decided to try this line after reading product reviews in a magazine. Surprise! They were so right. The best part? This awesome mascara is only 4.99! and has not increased in price in the 2-3 yrs I have been using it! I have used all the variations now and so far I find them all to be fresh, deep rich black color, smooth and creamy, full tube, smudgeproof, cakeproof, and non- clumping. The tube lasts a long time without drying out and there are several varieties to choose from. My favs are the green tube for washable daily wear and the waterproof formula for beach or sweaty days. All are great, I am personally not a fan of a curved wand in ANY BRAND mascara, but that is just my preference. You should really give this a try - at the price it's worth the risk to become amazed as I did!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This has quickly become my holy grail of mascaras due to how quickly it builds up my lashes to make them long, thick, and lush looking. However, it can be a bit clumpy (use an eyelash comb), smudges more easily than anything waterproof should, and can be very stubborn to remove (use oil on a cotton ball or cotton pad). Those factors aside, it's still a fantastic mascara and good enough that I'm willing to deal with those issues JUST for the big wide-eyed effect it gives my lashes."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I've been using a mascara, that I love, Benefit Roller mascara. The price at the national beauty supply store is now $27 a tube!!! The essence lash princess false lashes is amazing. I think it's better than benefit. I always felt the benefit dried out after a few weeks. I would have to run it under warm water to get it that smoother consistency. I've been using the essence for several weeks, it's still smooth, ""wet"". It's so easy to apply! I get the volume and length in 2 coats. My other mascara took forever. I only get faint smudges at the end of the day. It is a teeny bit stubborn to come off. I use The Ordinary squaline cleaner first then micellar water. That's always been my routine for a face full of makeup and it does the trick for this mascara. One more thing. From Amazon, the tube came shrink wrapped in plastic. I looked for it at said beauty supply store and not a single tube was in plastic, box, nothing. I wasn't comfortable with that. I'll be buying from Amazon."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I've tried every kind of mascara, from $8 drug store mascara to the high end $40+ stuff. I got this based off of a ""must have"" article online, and I thought ""For $5, it's worth a shot...how bad could it be?"" Let me just say, I'm glad I read that article. This stuff is AMAZING. I've converted all of my friends from their fancy stuff to this, and they all love it. It goes on nicely, stays on (I get the waterproof), and makes my lashes look great! A friend of mine owns a salon, and her girl that does lashes asked me what kind of mascara I used. When I told her, she was like ""No way that's $5 mascara!"" And just like that, I got another convert! Lol. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I am always looking to balance cost & value. I ordered the combo False Lash Effect (blue on black) & Volume Booster Lash Primer. I applied one coat of primer followed by one coat of mascara and ended up with natural and full lashes. Basically mascara and natural brow pencil are the only two items in my daily make up routine so natural appearance is important to me. When I first got it, I did layer the mascara over the mascara I was wearing- it did not clump - I think it would layer well for extra big lashes if you are looking for very dramatic results.  The product has not flaked or smudged in very humid FL, but was easily removed with my gentle face cleanser.  * random fact - the mascara is made in Luxembourg and the primer is made in Italy."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"DAY 3 I bought this waterproof mascara because we're going to the beach. It arrived last week and I wanted to ""test"" it. I put it on waited about 15 minutes and took a shower. I washed my face but not my eyes. When I got, I kind of fanned my lashes out with my finger and let them dry. I didn't rub them with a towel. They looked great! I didn't reapply mascara for 3 days. (I really just wanted to see how long it would stay on.) My lashes still looked fine after three showers. I didn't use any soap on my eyes and didn't rub them. When I was really to take it off I used coconut oil and gently wiped it off so I wouldn't pull any eyelashes out. The picture is on day 3 after 3 showers. My eyelashes are still a little wet and I didn't try to separate them because I was ready to remove the mascara. I wish I would have taken a day 1 picture because the first day they looked really good."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),I have to say this mascara is the bomb. I have spent up to 50.00 a tube just because it's high dollar doesn't mean it the best. If I could give 10 stars for this mascara I would. It's amazing. I have lashes that with out mascara I look like I have none. This mascara gives you amazing length value and separation. My lashes almost look false it's that great. I buy 3 tubes at a time. I'm hooked for life. And I know you will be too.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is the best mascara I’ve ever used. I go through so many different brands looking for the perfect mascara. This mascara adds so much volume and length in just the first application! I use waterproof and it’s very easy to remove with eye makeup remover, but absolutely does not smear when wet! Not to mention the price for this mascara, you couldn’t ask for a better price. Very inexpensive and I’m amazed by the quality. This is my forever Mascara!!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I'm a complete mascara snob using only Lancome for years. This item just started to pop up everywhere I looked. So I broke down and bought it to see what all the noise was about. I have to say I'm impressed. The mascara does elongate your eyelashes quite nicely. The brush is a perfect size with an appropriate handle. The mascara does not clump. I ordered the waterproof, and that feature is exceptional. I'm on board with all the fanfare about this item. Great product with a reasonable price!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),Hands down the best I ever had be my 7th order so far will buy more and try them all!
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is the best mascara I have ever owned and I have had plenty from drugstore brands to designer brands and this is hands down amazing. It delivers on its promise to make your lashes long that it looks like you are wearing false lashes. I tried it as soon as I got it and my lashes look amazing. I got the waterproof version and it lasts all day, no smudges and I removed it with micellar water. I am a customer for life and the price is also amazing. Buy this ladies, you won't regret it."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This inexpensive little beauty will give you the absolute biggest bang for your mascara buck that you've ever had! The ""False Lash Effect"" does not disappoint, and this 62 year old woman's tiny, sparse lashes are totally in love! The only thing to possibly complain about is that it's REALLY waterproof, meaning that without a high quality eye makeup remover, it'll last on your lashes for WEEKS! I love this so much that I buy it 5 at a time! It's a great product that this grandma wholeheartedly endorses!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I have purchased other mascaras that do the same as this product. That cost double the price of this one. The price is what makes this awesome. Yes! Yes! It’s waterproof. Went to the beach for several hours. Water, sweat actually head under water swimming. Went home hours later and still had on the mascara."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Some people learned how to bake bread or learned a new language during quarantine. I embarked on the brave journey of finding the perfect waterproof mascara. Babes, I tried them ALL. And what I found was more expensive definitely does not mean better. This mascara is the best one I tried, and the cheapest. I have like 7 eyelashes and this stuff makes me look like I have at least 20. My eyes water constantly and this stuff stays on. It will even stay on during a shower. All it takes for removal is some cleaning oil or balm and you’re good to go. Believe the hype on this one!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),Not only was this mascara insanely affordable but it lived up to all of the customer reviews on Amazon. The wand is thin but applies a nice amount of mascara without any clumping. I purchased the waterproof because I find it to hold the curl better than the regular formula. It did not smudge after a day's wear either. It removes fairly easily with makeup remover or Vaseline and it lengthens my lashes as advertised. This is a fantastic example that quality makeup does not have to cost a fortune.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I gave this a 3 star for easy to remove, because it's that good. It's waterproof, which means it's obviously doing it's job if it's a little harder than normal to clean off. You can't just use your regular makeup remover/face wash. I have to use a little bit of baby oil and a cotton ball to help clean it off. It lasts all day and really does help your lashes look longer. I won't purchase any other type of Mascara and I'm a bit of a mascara snob, because I do want longer, fuller looking lashes. Well, this gives you that."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I had given up on wearing makara, as I begun to loose my eye lashes when using smudge-proof maskara. After many years of makeup abstinence, I needed to use makeup to go to a wedding. I was happily surprised to find this product lasted me well into the night, but extremely happy to learn that this product and the cleaning products have a new formula. The secret on not loosing eyelashes is in both maskara and cleansers. THANK YOU ESSENCE!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"The best mascara I've bought on a long time!! I don't have the longest or fullest of lashes, but this mascara helps my lashes so much! I didn't realize that I bought the waterproof kind, but it's fine. Really great quality and I can't believe the price of it! I definitely recommend this to anyone who has trouble finding a decent mascara to make their lashes look nice. The wand is perfect, not that junky silicone wand that just doesn't work for us thin lash girls. Just buy it!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This might be the worst mascara I’ve ever used. I bought this mascara because I wanted to get the look of falsies without haven't something attached to my eyelid. But Lord have mercy. I have one word for you: clump. This mascara is incredibly thick and goopy, so my eyelashes stuck together like nobody’s business. I looked like I had three enormous eyelashes on my eye. Imagine Cynthia’s hair from Rugrats. My eyelashes looked like her hair. I tried wiping off the excess on the brush onto a paper towel. I tried wiping off excess onto the top of the bottle. It still had insane amounts of mascara on the brush. And then I accidentally blinked. And I got this stuff on my skin. I used the micellar water that removes waterproof makeup and all it did was smear. I rubbed the skin under my eye raw trying to get this off. Just don’t buy it. Don’t waste your time. Don’t waste your money. Just...no."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I usually use the regular non waterproof version of this mascara and I love it, it’s volumizing and just very nice. But if I cry with it on which I seem to be quite the cryer it doesn’t hold up. But the waterproof one absolutely saved my makeup on my wedding day, cuz I was a mess. I cried the second I started my walk and when I spoke for my vows. So definitely a great pick for the way it makes the lashes look and not bleeding at all. It didn’t flake and was pretty easy to wash off with some face soap and water. Definitely get it"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Bailey said on one of her videos that this was her favorite mascara hands-down. I immediately ordered because I've tried them all. Youngblood, younique, better than sex, they're real, etc. None compare to this mascara! I cannot rave enough and the super low price is an added bonus! I would say the only ""downfall"" that actually doesn't bother me is that I can't figure out how to get the waterproof mascara off my lashes! Easily wipes off your face using lotion but I've had it on my lashes for like 3 days even with taking a shower. Haha. BUY IT!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Not going to lie, I was skeptical of this mascara but I am amazed! I have cried plenty of times with this mascara because I am a sad and angry crier and it doesn't budge. The only way I can really get this off is using my cerave fash wash and the makeup eraser. Highly recommend it to the skeptic!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I am 46 and have tried ALL the hype mascaras. And this is one of the very best, period. For the price, it's unbeatable. The reason I like the waterproof better than the regular is that waterproof holds the curl all day and doesn't smudge. I use jojoba oil to remove, and it comes off easily. Only complaint is that this will last only about a month before going clumpy. But for the price, you can get a new one."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is the BEST mascara you will ever use! It makes your lashes SO long and full without clumping or causing tarantula eyes lol. I would put this up against ANY other mascara! Even the ones that people spend wayyyy too much for. It’s $5 and proves, without a doubt, that expensive isn’t always better! I’d literally give it a 20 out of 10 stars if i could. And this isn’t one of those fake reviews we’re fooled by on here a lot. It’s a REAL review from REAL experience with the product!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),This mascara hands down is the best mascara I have ever used. The only thing that I have a problem with is that the mascara somehow gets on the outside of the container and I end up getting it all over my hands but that has nothing to do with the product the product is amazing it last very long time it doesn’t come off unless you want it off I found that I use baby oil and it takes it off pretty easy compared to make up remover I would definitely recommend this and I’ve bought this several times.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Guys. This mascara is WOW! I was so skeptical buying something based off advertising, but with such a low price, I went for it. I have bought handfuls more of this product and I now give it as gifts! This stuff is phenomenal! Get it!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),I picked up this mascara (waterproof) on Prime Day not expecting much at this price point. WOW! I have used mascara 4x the cost of this and you could put them head to head any day. I'm not sure I'll ever buy another mascara again! It's easy enough to remove with regular makeup remove. It doesn't flake off during the day. My lashes still feel soft and natural. You can put in 1 quick coat for a more natural look or layer it on for more volume. Usually 2 or 3 coats is all I've done or felt like I needed.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I absolutely love this stuff! I’m not a big makeup person but this blew me away. Who need false lashes when you gave this mascara?! I wore it swimming in the ocean in very hot, humid weather with no issues of smudging. My only issue is it is so waterproof, it’s difficult to remove even with double cleansing. I might need to try makeup remover. I’ll absolutely buy this again but probably not waterproof next time."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),So happy I decided to try this mascara... Works great and the price is a bonus... I've used the same Loreal mascara for 15+ yrs and have tried others in between but none impressed me until now... I've already recommended it to my friends...
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I've used many different brands of mascara. I wear it essentially every day, and I wear a lot of it when I'm dancing. This mascara is indeed waterproof, so it's good when I'm swimming or working up a sweat. It comes off easily with makeup remover, which helps extend the life of my false lashers. It didn't create any additional length or volume in comparison to other brands, but that isn't why I bought it."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I questioned how much I would really like this mascara. I have very light colored I would say they are practically non-existent. This mascara definitely gave my lashes a boost and made them noticeably longer and fuller looking (compared to what they are) which is great for me. It’s more than any mascara I’ve had. The other incredible thing about this is that I have NEVER found a truly waterproof mascara. This stays in place through tears, rain, sweat…you name it. That is what I have always wanted. That being said it definitely takes a bit to get off…but I would take the effort to get it off to how much I live this product!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I've never posted a pic, but I'm impressed with this mascara...hence the post. I tried a couple other brands and seemed like they'd be flaking off into my contacts within a half day. This doesn't. Do like that it's water proof, but isn't hard on my lashes when removing it. I use makeup pads and Neutrogena makeup remover. This is two coats and if I add another, it starts to get a bit clumpy. But, all in all I'll keep using it as long as I can."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"It really does make natural lashes look like falsies and it doesn’t come off easily…. which is good for wearing but not so fun when you are tired and trying to remove it. 😄 Again, that’s not a fault of the product, it is awesome. You just need to find a good remover. I haven’t found any that takes it off easily. And it comes off in clumps that can get into your eyes. With all that said, if you want the look, get it."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Y'all. This stuff is great!!! I was out doing water activities for HOURS and this stuff didn't budget once!! Even when completely submerged under water, my lashes stayed looking long! It even made it through an hour long cry session following said water activities (we love exhaustion) and they still looked the same 😌💅 it's easy to remove if you've got a good makeup remover/micellar water!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I was a big fan of Lancome mascara because it was the only waterproof mascara that was actually water and sweat proof. I tried others but always went back to the $30 stuff because it's important to me not to have my mascara running when I was running (see what I did there?). Anyway, I tried this $5 mascara on a whim and I'm blown away. It's as good as Lancome!! Big win for me. It applies well, stays put and comes off when I wash my face."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),Never thought I would say waterproof was too much. But this mascara is like cement. Did get a refund. Will try one that's not waterproof. My makeup remover would not completely remove it nicely. I'd like the brush I liked how it looked I liked how it went on. Just did not like that I could not get it off. I am updating my review and giving this a 5-star the waterproof is hard to get off but I tried the green one it comes off easier not waterproof but I would highly recommend this mascara. I would only get the waterproof if you really need it.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),Read all the reviews and decided to try out this mascara. All the mascaras I’ve tried always give me the raccoon eyes after a few hours due to my oily skin. First time I tried this was during a hot summer day and for a children’s party. No raccoons eye throughout the whole day! Glad I tried this one out. Now a believer in this mascara.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I have been looking for a good mascara, so I did what I always do... research. And Essence Lash Princess False Lashes kept coming up on list after list. I was dubious, but I figured what the heck, it's cheap, so no biggie if it's just unsubstantiated hype. It's definitely not just hype, though. This stuff is MAGIC!!!! It's not cakey or clumpy or flakey. My lashes are still really soft and they look SUPER long. I feel like I have YouTube influencer lashes now!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Lash lady said my lashes were too small for a lift or perm, but with this mascara I got the length I was looking for. My lashes usually don’t keep a curl all day, but hasn’t been a problem today. Super happy I purchased it."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I found the original version of this mascara through a listicle of best cheap beauty products-I had no complaints about that one except that I prefer waterproof as I’m pretty active and sweat a lot, which doesn’t mix well with eye makeup. It’s honestly so good for being so affordable, it doesn’t clump which is my major issue w a lot of mascaras, and it definitely makes a difference with my lashes (as in, I look like I have some now). Stays put through exercise, rain, exercise in the rain…I’ll be switching to this mascara indefinitely as my primary self improvement tool."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Waterproof is an understatement! I rode quads on a mountain in Puerto Rico in a rainstorm and this mascara DID NOT MOVE. The rest of my face melted into my eyes and it was terrible but this mascara.... perfect.... with that being said, you will need a good makeup remover because it's difficult to get off. But I used the elf jelly cleanser and it takes it off well. It kind of leaves a little residue afterwards but you can just wipe away when you finish your skincare."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I have tried a lot of mascara, mostly because I need length!!!! This gives me length and makes my lashes appear like they have volume as well. I live in Florida so I will say on really hot days it sheds, but I have yet to find a mascara that give the same results that doesn’t either! I use to use Too Face better than sex and in my opinion this is better and so is the price. We all have our favs but I definitely recommend."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I love this mascara!!! I have tried all kinds of high end expensive mascaras and you can never even tell I have any on because of how little my lashes are. I tried getting lash extensions but they weren't for me, too hard to not get them wet and too itchy. This mascara works SO good. I put 2 coats on and it looked almost like I had false lashes on. And the price is SO cheap!!! I will be using this all the time."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Takes a little getting used, lasts most of the day, still leaves smudges under my eyes after about 8 hours. The brush is thin and not fluffy like the mascaras I have always used, it would be a nice option if given, I still have black smudging under my eyes after a few hours. I buy waterproof mascara since I use eye cream under my makeup, set my makeup with powder and I still have this issue with all mascaras. I was hoping this one would work for me."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I usually get the non-waterprrof one but I needed the waterproof for my wedding. So I'm a crier. I cry when I'm happy, angry, over-joyed, etc. So needless to say I cried so many happy tears that day.  THIS SAVED MY WEDDING PICTURES. Had I not gone with the I would have looked like I had partied too hard before the ceremony.  Also I am allergic to most makeup- even hypoallergenic items. This gave me no issues."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),I wear contacts and have problems with mascara especially if it isn't waterproof. I have to be careful that it doesn't flake or cause any eye irriation and this one is fantastic! It blew me away the first time I put it on and it made me look like I had false lashes on and that was with just one coat. Its super pigmented and goes on so smooth with zero clumps and you can't beat the price. Next time I'm going to order 2 so that I can gift one to my Mom because she loved how it made my lashes look.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Wore this to my sons wedding and had no issues with it running when I cried a little. Made my very thin lashes look like they exist. I would not say that they brought 4x the volume to my lashes, but it was the best mascara I have tried in a while. Unfortunately, someone else must have like it also because it disappeared out of my makeup bag so I had to replace it."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is the only mascara I buy anymore! It’s so cheap and it makes my lashes look insane! I already have super long and curled lashes, but I’m a redhead so they’re really light. This mascara lengthens them without making them look clumpy and as someone who has really oily skin and even waterproof mascara comes off under my eyes, this one doesn’t! It’s the only one I buy anymore. Highly recommend!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is my favorite mascara. Actually, I use the non-waterproof directly on my lashes, and a coat of this (waterproof) on top of that to prevent smudging, as the other does leave raccoon eyes on its own. My method isn't 100%, more like 80%, but the small amount of touch up is worth it because this is the best mascara I've ever worn."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Throw your $35 mascara away! This is all you need! I used an eyelash curler, and applied two coats and my lashes were longer and had even more volume. It's not going to give you the look of false lashes, but it WILL make them a lot longer. You will also need to use a makeup remover that is for waterproof mascara. I use Almay brand makeup remover pads. Trust me, this mascara is amazing!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),This is the best mascara I have ever bought it last all day. It definitely lengthens your lashes and makes them look fuller and the best of all is that it is smudge proof and waterproof.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"It is hard to believe that this inexpensive mascara does such a great job. It supplies thickness and length and is very easy to apply. But, I have to use eye makeup remover to get it all off, but that's not a problem for I know most women use it. You cannot go wrong with this product."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Love this mascara and love the fact that it is waterproof. I use the Essence regular mascara as well, but if I am working out in the heat, the waterproof/sweat proof mascara is my go to mascara. Makes lashes look super lush and long, but it doesn’t wear off or smudge. Great value too!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I've bought high-end mascara, and I've bought drugstore mascara, but I've never bought a better mascara. This stuff is intensely pigmented, quickly & easily adds length and thickness, and dries quickly. My ONLY complaint (and it's really not) is that it can be a chore to get off. That is, however, the flip-side of having a mascara that never smudges or budges.  Love it - will 100% buy again!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),This mascara is magic. I feel like I should buy 100 of them just in case they stop making it. I have small lashes and this has made a huge difference. It goes on easily and stays on even while swimming. It is a little difficult to remove like all waterproof mascaras. I have been using this as well as Revitalash and I have long lashes now for the first time in my life!
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I'm not one for writing reviews. However I will for this product. I usually have to wear a very high dollar mascara as my eyes are so so sensitive. I thought for the price why not give it a try and I did! I purchased the waterproof. I now have my new brand of mascara! It lasts, doesn't smudge, and makes my tiny lashes look wonderful!! I'm almost hitting the 60 year's around the moon..so, kudo's to the maker's of this product! I've recommended this highly to friends!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I bought many mascaras and Dior is one of my favorites but pricey. I tried so many and for waterproof mascara, so many clump. Despite saying they don't. I finally found this one and it really makes the lashes look like false eyelashes, no clumping and easy to remove. I love it and will buy again."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),lives up to being waterproof.. does not really add volume but does separate and lengthen the lashes. My eyes are always tearing and this mascara in long wearing.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I have tried so many mascaras. The pricey ones, the tried and true drug store ones. All the highest rated ones. But they all disappointed me. Then I saw the reviews and price of this one!! Fullness, very black, length. I use the waterproof type. Definitely recommend!!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),This wonderful mascara has become the only one I use as it meets all my qualifications beautifully; It adds lashes color-definition & volume while remaining smudgeproof & mostly waterproof. The particular one this company makes that I like has a Black Tube with Blue Writing.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"It is winter so the real test will be summer heat however I am pleased with this purchase. The tube is so cute, the wand just right, it can be removed easily with face wash tho I do intend to make or buy a conditioning remover soon and the mascara itself does what it says it does and for the price, you cannot go wrong. Try this one."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),This is hands down my favorite mascara. I found it when I read a friends post and someone replied that she really like this brand. So I tried it. I have been buying it ever since & have set up a subscription so I never run out. I highly recommend & there are so many choice for however you like to wear your lashes.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"After falling in love with the regular mascara, I got the waterproof version because I live in the South where humidity ruins everything. It worked fantastically for everyday wear so I decided to try it out at the beach while playing in the waves for hours. It held up amazingly. After 6 hours of salty waves making both direct and indirect hits to my face, only a few smudges were noticeable and wiped away easily leaving still gorgeous lashes."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I LOVE this mascara!! I'm 67, I have tried them all..this is the best at making those lovely long lashes the young girls have today..easy to wash off, unless it's the waterproof version, then get the Neutrogena eye makeup remover n it will come off easily.. this hold up, not cakey, and affordable!! Good stuff grandma..(great for u young girls too)..try it!!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"So I wanted to try this since I’ve heard so many great things… I do prefer a rubbery brush, so I’m trying to get used to the bristles🥴. It’s very ‘buildable’ my lashes thin and it makes them look nice and thick, but it does weigh them down (I like them curled up nicely) and I noticed they have fallen a bit more than with my usual stuff! 🤷🏼‍♀️"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I hate putting on mascara because I hate something touching my eye so close. But this stuff is worth it, it makes my lashes look so much longer and fuller and it doesn't require multiple applications to get it on thick (so less eye touching). Will only be buying this mascara from now on."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is a great mascara! I already have long lashes so this product helps to make them bolder. The combination of this waterproof mascara, different colors of waterproof eyeliner, and different shades of eye shadows, my blue eyes look like sapphires. I have received many compliments from my co-workers and the owners of the spa that I work at. I have to use a waterproof eye makeup remover to take it all off at the end of the night."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This waterproof mascara is exactly that, waterproof! No smudging for two days. If you want something easily removable, don’t buy the waterproof. This mascara has some serious volume control. Easily doubles my lash length! 5 out of 5 ⭐️‘S!!!! Would HIGHLY recommend."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is the BEST mascara ever. Stop reading, and buy many! It's great for lenth and volume, and does it better than any expensive brand I've bought. I read a recommendation for this in a social media group and decided to try it. The first day I wore it, I received two compliments on my lashes! Now I recommend it when someone asks for a great mascara. I bought a tube for my sister too!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I used the non waterproof for everyday, and the waterproof and I think I might cry or something :-). Or be out in the wind, anytime my eyes might water. It's a little harder to get to waterproof one off, but it's doable for sure as most waterproof mascaras are. 100% recommend!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),My go-to was L’Oréal Voluminous. This creates more volume with a single application. More affordable too. Has a bristle brush not those awful rubbery applicators. Truly waterproof. Easily removable with miscellar water. Will be stocking up on more of these mascaras.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I don't know if it's due to my purchasing it online or just a ""not as good"" lot. Unfortunately this crumbles and I find it on my eyelids and under my lower lash line after a few minutes to a half hour after applying, then all day long. I Will be purchasing More because I love this product but unfortunately wont from this same company, sorry."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I finally was on my last tube of stocked piled goto. I had literally used Urban Decay Big Fatty over 10 years. I read online lash princess was more like Big Fatty than UD current products. Well I had never used a waterproof, but it stays on just right without coon eyes. My lashes have never looked longer. I am on my second week of use. I have had no breakage."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),I love this waterproof version of the false effect mascara. The green one would give me terrible raccoon eyes and I don’t even live in a humid environment. The only downside is waterproof stuff is hard to get off and I noticed it taking a few lashes with it when removing even as gentle as I could. Great cheap mascara that makes my eyelashes look amazing. A definite staple in my bag now.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),I've tried quite a few different mascaras. This one is actually water proof and looks like I put falsies on. Made it through an entire day at the water park at Great wolf. Still looked amazing at the end of the day. Very easy to get off with a makeup remover cloth.
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"My 3 stars for “easy to remove” is a good thing because this stuff STAYS ON! If you are looking for a truly waterproof mascara, this is it! That being said, there is NO mascara that won’t smudge if your eyelashes are naturally long and skin is oily. I remove this with Almay oily eye makeup remover, then use my face makeup remover, then my facial cleanser!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is my new favorite mascara!!! It glides on super smooth, zero clumping and literally only takes one stroke to get good coverage plus length! I have seasonal allergies so this time of year my eyes water a lot and I've had no smudging/raccoon eye whatsoever..however, I use coconut oil as a facial moisturizer and didn't have time to let it soak in completely one day and it did smudge a bit that day otherwise make-up remover or rubbing with coconut oil takes it off nicely, but just washing with soap and water won't take it off."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Took a shower no more than fifteen minutes and this is how it looked afterwards. Most people apply more mascara than I do, but I think it'll still work. I used a make-up remover/cleanser and it came off easily. Had to lightly kind of rub my eyes because I got shampoo in them. Pair this review with other people's reviews on the mascara overall."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"let me start by saying it's humid af in Texas and the Saharan dust just rolled in 🙅🏻‍♀️ this is the first mascara I've tried that didn't smudge or flake AT ALL after all day wear and tear. I put it on at 8am and after allergy eye drops, errands, a nap, rubbed eyes, and all...this stuff STILL looks fresh and clean!!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This is the best waterproof mascara I have found! I've used high, mid, and low priced ones. but this is the winner for me! No more racoons eyes! Stayed on all day and only came off with eye makeup remover or oil (I used castor oil). Tried it out on one of the hottest days so far, and did not rub off. Very happy with my purchase and at an excellent price point!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"Have an important event coming out and I don’t want to wear false lashes, nor do I want runny mascara.gave this one a try-put while biking (!) in the heat and I was pleased and surprised by the fact that it did not run, schmear or loose effect. Multiple coats give big effect but be careful of clumps. If you choose to layer have a lash comb at hand."
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"I wear high end mascaras and saw the rave reviews this mascara had. I thought I’d try the waterproof mascara since it’s summer and …. I am IN LOVE! Lengthens, lasts all day, gives volume, and wears so nice. I will be buying the none waterproof for sure! I actually might prefer over higher end lines!"
essence | Lash Princess 假睫毛防水睫毛膏 | 无动物实验(1 件装),"This will be the first time I tried this brand of mascara. It was recommended on a video on You Tube. Very happy I ordered it. It is my new favorite and will order again. Just the right amount comes off the brush, no clumping. Very pleased"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,Perfect size for my friend’s Nash Bash goodie bags! They loved them! These work so well & definitely came in handy to remove our makeup after nights out. Great product! The lil size is so cute too!
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"Great first step of a double cleanse. Easily removes makeup (even waterproof mascara) with minimal rubbing. Zero eye irritation as it does not leave an oily film like most others I've tried. I've seen people complaining about wasteful packaging and per-unit price, but it depends on your use case. I only wear makeup maybe once a week, and the wipe multi-packs dry out before I can even use half of them, so this is a much better option for me. They're also great for travel. So glad I found these!"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"These are a great product in general, but brilliant for traveling. They come individually wrapped in about an inch square package and unfold to approx 10” x 10” (or a tad larger). I have sensitive eyes & these do not hurt or irritate whatsoever, plus they don’t leave a greasy film in my eyes at all. One towelette is enough to remove all my mascara & face make-up as they are not only a generous size, but are also thick & strong too. Finally, they’re gentle on my skin, as well as my eyes, & I have had no sensitivity issues with my face either. A definite A+ for home use as well as for traveling."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,Perfect for travel AND everyday home use. I love the scent. It’s not overpowering and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. They remove my makeup in one swipe (no scrubbing) and they are packaged perfectly for travel. I travel for work and these are the best option because they fit easily in a makeup bag or purse and never dry out! I use them for travel and home just for that reason alone.

The best part is they are ‘wet’ with just the right amount of ingredients... I was worried maybe they’d be on the dry side but they aren’t. These are now a new addition to my beauty kit and tricks. They also are especially nice to have on hand when out on a date, or a long day away."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片, I’ve been using Neutrogena for many years and was happy they finally made smaller travel friendly version. Empty the bag in your makeup case for grab and go! You don’t need to scrub your face with these. They are very good if you have sensitive areas on your face
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,I loved this product already. I only use these for makeup removal. Tried to buy a less expensive product before and I ended up with pink eye in both eyes which.....maybe it wasnt the makeup remover but I wasnt gonna risk it again. The travel size was nice as I was going to visit a friend out of state and these were much easier to travel with. I wouldnt use these regularly as they create more waste but it was definitely better to travel with these then the full size container.
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE These individual Neutrogenia wipes. I’ve been using these for years in like bulk packs. But they would invariably dry out by the time I got to the bottom of the pack. Even if I got a smaller one, which wasn’t always cost effective when you start calculating. But using these individual ones. Not only are they MORE COST EFFECTIVE, but because they are individually wrapped, they are stronger and more convenient. I can’t believe I haven’t found them before. AND….The ones in bulk, I have NEVER, EVER been able to ALL of my eye make up, AND face makeup off with just one wipe. (And I don’t even wear that much makeup), but these singles get everything off. I mean TOTALLY BRILL! Love it!! I just grab one and wipe while I’m watching TV, or reading or whatever. I keep a few in various places so I can keep my face clean and fresh feeling when I want to, when I want to. Even if you don’t wear makeup everyday, like me. Working from home for years now, I’m still a huge stickler for skin hygiene. And it all starts with a clean foundation. And this helps. I have even been using them on my husband. And his skin is looking better! Gosh I sound like a commercial. Sorry, I just really love these individual Neutrogenia wipes. 🥰"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"These are great! I don't know about you, but I'm a huge fan of stocking up on travel and emergency friendly products. My purse is a virtual Swiss Army knife of ""what if"" items (90% of which I never use and which makes it ridiculously heavy, but you know, I'm paranoid like that lol).  I wear makeup and also have rather oily skin woes, so facial wipes are an OG in my skin care routine. I like having something on hand to freshen up or remove the day's makeup if I'm not at home, but I don't want to lug around a giant pack of wipes. Obviously, these provide an excellent solution. They aren't quite as cost effective as a standard pack of wipes (nor should one expect them to be considering the additional packaging of being individually wrapped), but they are still pretty reasonable regardless!  As for the size, they are definitely super compact and cute. However, they are not totally flat. They're a little more puffed out than I'd invisioned in my head. That's not a complaint, just something to consider if you were planning to tuck one of these into your wallet or something. They are still very compact for pocket or purse, but they just aren't as flat and slim as would fit into a wallet or stack up neatly against each other.  The other nice thing is that, in a pinch, these can always double as a ""personal wipe"" for bathroom use, or as a wipe for hands, or for other quick cleanups. Obviously they aren't marketed for those purposes, but considering they're designed for use on your face and even removing makeup on your eyes, I can only assume they'd be gentle enough for those alternative uses.  Lastly, as for the wipes themselves, if you've used the standard Neutrogena makeup wipes, these are exactly the same. Effective, gentle, pleasant light fragrance, and great at cleansing without drying you out. An added bonus is that being individually wrapped ensures no accidental drying out of the wipe inside. Really a great product for travel or just to keep on hand as cleansing backup."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"Wow. Am I glad I tried these! I have tried many types of make-up removers - many major brands, expensive department store brands, creams, wipes, etc. It seems everything leaves something behind. Plus you still need to rinse your face, and most leave my face feeling dry. Well, not this product! First, the convenience - each individual wipe is wrapped in its own little packet. So easy for travel - tiny! But they unfold into a nice size wipe. Plus, being individually wrapped, no opening a package and finding all the rest of your wipes dried out. Next - these wipes truly work! They remove ALL my makeup and with a simple wipe, not a scrub. Just open and wipe gently, and all your makeup is removed. The proof is taking toner and in the past everything else left makeup on the cotton when I applied toner. Well, using these - NO leftover makeup. A clean cotton swab. Now for the bonus - these wipes do not require a rinse! Wow! My face feels clean and refreshed, no dryness. So I can refresh/clean my face anywhere, even if I don’t have access to water. I do not even feel the need for the toner anymore either. The price is also very reasonable! I won’t be without these anymore. They are now on my auto ship list!"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"Love these. I take them with me wherever I go. I like how compact they are. Too many times I have accidentally left the adhesive sticker off the top of the big package when I travel and by the time I get home they have dried out. I have had no issues with the individual packs. I personally do not have sensitive skin so I can not speak to how it would impact someone who does. I wear eyeshadow, eye liner, mascara, and anything else you can think of and one wipe can get my whole face clean. I have purchased these 3 times now and will continue to do so. Give them a try and pop a few in your bag to use when you need it!"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"Great for travel, the gym, going from work to an evening function and you want to wash, refresh and put on a fresh face. I usually like cleansers with the little scrubber beads. This surprisingly takes off your makeup. I do not break out so I know it does a great job cleaning. Even on nights where I am exhausted and I would normally say to myself “1 night without cleaning won’t hurt”. Pull one of these out wash with cloth and throw away. Best is you do not have to spend extra time figuring out how to get the makeup out of a wash cloth. I have both the large packets in the plastic box for my bathroom and the single packets for trips, work, the gym and you are on the go."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"I love these for traveling. While the individual packaging isn’t my favorite environmentally, I love it for every other reason there is. They are so convenient and don’t require you to pack and entire big pack of makeup wipes, or a bottle of cleanser. I’ve been using the formula for a long time - I have sensitive skin prone to drying out, but these wipes don’t dry me out at all! I always follow up with moisturizer, but the few times I forgot my skin was still not overly dry. There is a slight clean smell to them but nothing overpowering. Also doesn’t sting my eyes at all to remove eye makeup - many other cleaners do for me (micellar water for example). The packaging on these is a little bit thick which can make it hard to open sometimes since they’re so small, but they each have a little tear in them already to get you started so it’s usually manageable. Plus side of the thick packaging is I’ve never had a dry makeup wipe. Even with a bag of them that I had for 6 months."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"For reference, I have acne prone and eczema prone skin that is super sensitive. So, my options are fairly limited with what I can put on my face. This product came recommended to me by people who also have these skin issues. I have to say after using this makeup wipe, I will never use anything else again! Not only is this super gentle and non-irritating, but it also literally gets all of the makeup off of my face (even the waterproof mascara) in one use. Given how well this performs and how gentle it is I will continue to use it as long as I wear makeup."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"I absolutely love these, I always buy around 2/3 packs every 2 months, Price is amazing and its quite a bunch of them per bag, but I do have really sensitive skin, they work amazing into removing any type of make-up but it's not something you will like in your skin overnight , I recommend using micellar cleansing water afterwards just because the solution they use for these wipes are kind of ruff on sensitive skin , BUT I DEFINETLY RECOMEND 10/10"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,I love how these cloths clean my face without leaving my skin feeling dry. They take off all my makeup. Nice that they are individually wrapped so I can toss a few in my suitcase or purse and know that they won't get dried out like a dispenser package sometimes does if you don't seal it correctly.
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"I discovered this product when My dermatologist used the product to remove my makeup. I loved it so much that I purchased it immediately. He did not use the individual wipes which were fragrance free. I prefer individual wrapped wipes because they don’t dry out. I was disappointed to find the individual wrapped wipes have fragrance. It’s a nice fragrance but any fragrance is a skin irritatant. Otherwise, I love how it easily removes makeup. Makeup on a washcloth does not always get removed in the washing machine."

It is scented, but not overly. Does not leave my skin greasy afterwards, and does not dry it either. Perfect pocket size. I recommend. I am 40 and have sensitive skin, and for now, no complaints..."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,I don't wear makeup very often so when I would buy a tub of makeup remover wipes they would always dry out before I needed them again. So having these individually wrapped is perfect for me. I wore a full face of makeup the other day with waterproof mascara and eyeliner and these wipes removed it all. My skin is very sensitive and I have lots of broken capillaries so I can't rub my skin too much and these are gentle but effective. These cloths do feel a bit scratchier than the tub version but I can deal for the individually wrapped.
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"I don't wear makeup everyday, so the individually wrapped makeup wipes were an easy decision for me. Now all the wipes are completely fresh when I need them. The wipe is large enough to remove a full face of makeup, and removes it very easily. My eyes are on the dry side and rubbing can cause irritation and even corneal abrasions. These wipes make removing eye makeup very quick and easy and prevent excess irritation to the eyes. Im also very sensitive to fragrances and while these wipes have a fragrance, it isn't overwhelming and does not cause me skin or sinus irritation. Great product, definitely recommend"

At the end of my day before I drive home I pop open one of these bad boys and take all my makeup off! It’s very effective at taking off makeup, mascara, eyeliner, and eyelash glue. One wipe does the trick every time. I also like that they are individually wrapped, so they never dry out! I just ordered another shipment!"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"I work on bikes, often not my own on the side of the road. Inevitably, my hands get bike grease, road dirt and other grossness that usually requires Lava soap at home to remove. Hand sanitizer is nearly worthless. One day, while helping a woman with her bike, she offered me a travel makeup face wipe, and it actually removed the bike grease. I'm sure that's probably obvious to any person that wears makeup, but it was a revelation for myself. After learning about this, I wanted to keep a few in my bag, not only for myself, but others who might have their hands coated in bike grease. These are very affordable, small and effective. I couldn't be more pleased."

I always go back to Neutrogena. I use to buy the ones that came together in one package however went I would get to the last few ones, they didn't have much moist to them. I love the single pack because they stay moist. You can place a couple or three in your purse, beach or sports bag. After I take my makeup off with them, my face feels so soft! I highly recommend buying this brand and the singles!"
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,So easy to through in my purse on these hot Texas summer days! And they clean well too. Some other brands don’t clean all the dirt and oil and it causes my face to not feel clean and even break out. NOT NEUTROGENA make up remover cloths. This cloth cleans my face and I can trust that it’s cleaned the dirt and oils and leaving my face fresh and clean.
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,I never buy make up wipes and definitely don’t use this brand for anything because I’m very picky about ingredients but I decided to buy these to keep in our camper for taking my make up off while camping. I wipe my make up off and then wash my face and it just made it easier in the camper. They stayed moist in their individual wrappers all summer long. Worth the price for only using them every now and then!

Neutrogena has a quality reputation so I decided to try it. Fortunately I made a great choice - these towelettes worked great! They easily knocked the makeup right off, didn't irritate may face at all, and didn't leave me with a ""perfumey smell"" afterwards. I can recommend this product to anybody."

The regular container would always dry out the wipes in the bottom before I could use them. Having the individual sizes is FANTASTIC! GREAT for traveling and home too. They do a great job of cleaning full face of makeup prior to washing and using them is a lot more sensitive on my skin than trying to scrub off full face (concealer, foundation, multiple shadows, powder, liner, mascara, lip liner, lipstick). Highly recommend."
Neutrogena 露得清 卸妆湿巾 单支 日常面部湿巾 去除污垢、油脂、化妆品和防水睫毛膏 温和独立包装 100% 植物基纤维 20片,"I'm allergic to tocopheryl acetate, so it's really hard for me to find wipes, soaps, and shampoos that my skin doesn't react to. These do not have tocopheryl, and they work great. I think the price point is also very good. The small packets are wonderful to keep in my purse. I didn't think I'd use them very often, but I do! So, I'll keep the rest of the package of individually wrapped ones for travel, and I'm buying a larger tub of the wipes for at home use -- perfect for removing makeup at the end of the day."

Like travel, camping, and under the couch cushion for when I'm totally lazy and don't feel like going to wash up before falling asleep in front of tv lol! They smell nice, none have been dried up, and they even remove my waterproof mascara. The cloth is large & thick enough to do my entire face well. I don't use them often that's why I got these individual wrapped ones. Or else I would've saved a lot of money getting the big package. I haven't broken out from these."

So instead of putting out 10 at a time in a basket, I reduced it to 4. They still disappeared. So I switched to a dispenser as opposed to the individually wrapped ones. :("

I will say that I notice my skin becomes a little oily about 3/4 of the way through my day, but it's nothing like it was before I started using this product. I also LOVE the scent - it's very light and clean smelling. I was worried this would leave my face feeling wet, but it is just a light mist and it soaks into the skin in less than 20 seconds. There are no streaks or marks left behind. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who suffers from oily skin or a humid environment."

All my life I'd spend a total of 3 minutes doing my makeup the 2 or 3 days that I would use it. I'm now paying more attention to myself and of course, covid happens. I'm so glad I did my research and found this spray to help keep my makeup on my face, not my mask. This setting spay is amazing, I give my face one spray before I apply any makeup, I give my foundation/brush a spray when blending then two final sprays on my face when I'm finished. I love it!"

I don't normally wear foundation/powder on a daily basis but when I do, I know I end up having to bring a tissue to make sure I dab the oil off after 20 minutes. I was a bit skeptical because of the price but after reading the reviews, I decided why not. I have been using the urban decay setting spray but it's ok, I still have to dab after an hour. This one made my face look fresh as a daisy all night long and my skin felt awesome. This will be my go-to from now on."

My makeup literally would not move if I was in a hurricane. Thank you Milani. I literally douse myself in this with pride and will also use it as a fixer so to speak throughout the day. I hope they never discontinue this! It has a very light very lovely scent. The spray comes out perfectly. It covers your face completely evenly, and sets everything perfectly into place. I could put my hands on my face I could lie down and literally wake up and my makeup will still be there! This is a dupe for the Urban Decay all nighter if not better in my opinion. And for the price on here you cannot beat it! Trust me give it a shot and you will love it! It is not drying nor does it feel greasy or anything it just feels like pure H2O lightly spritzing on your face and within minutes it is absorbed and your makeup is locked into place. You want to make sure all of your hard work is locked away for the day! My go-to forever and ever"

The longevity is not quite as good, but it's so easy to do a quick fix and the bottles are smaller and more convenient for travel. although there are more expensive product that compared it to had slightly better longevity, the overall effect and appearance was subpar. do you really want to look worse for longer periods of time throughout the day?

We were going on a hike which was about the only thing we could do together without me wanting to sprint in the other direction. Even though I knew I’d be in the woods, I didn’t want to be judged by my father so I applied a thin layer of makeup. I finished all of it off with a spritz of this setting spray.

Smell isn't awful, but I'm not particularly fond of it. When initially sprayed it does have a sticky or tacky feeling, and takes longer to dry than other brands I've used."

I usually stick with the Elf setting spray but I wanted to try something different and this works well! It’s pretty sticky so I’d imagine it makes a good primer as well, and as far as holding my makeup on, it’s done a great job! Because of the stickiness, I do add a tiny bit of setting powder after spraying rather than before (like I’ve always done) and that seems to work well. It’s not mattifying but doesn’t leave you shiny either. I love the subtle dewy glow and it smells so good, which is more than I can say for the Elf setting spray. If you don’t like a heavily perfumed product however, I’d stay away from this. I do have sensitive and acne prone skin and this hasn’t done anything to break me out or cause any irritation. Honestly, I think this is my new fav!"

Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,It helps to keep my makeup looking good and lasting all day. It makes my makeup look glowy and not greasy (I have oily skin). Especially helps when my makeup is looking a little cakey sometimes. Definitely one of my favorite setting sprays.

I Just spritz some into my hand and wipe it around my face and then wait a minute and put on my base. It does the job well! sometimes I spray some on my face after but have not really needed to do so.
Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,I adore this setting spray. It really holds your makeup in place and feels refreshing on the skin. It has a light floral smell when sprayed but the fragrance quickly disappears. I went to a concert in a building that had no fans or air conditioning and by the time the concert was finished everyone was hot and dripping with sweat. I was a sweaty mess but my makeup was still intact and flawless! I HIGHLY recommend this setting spray.

At the end of the afternoon, my make-up is still on my face and not inside the mask. This product cost 1/3 of what someone I know recommended from a popular cosmetics retailer. And it's working just the same way. I recommend."

Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,Gives me a dewy set but it lasts and that’s all I can ask for! I normally go for Urban Decay all Nighter or Morphe. This is my first time venturing from those and I like it. Smells much better than urban decay all nighter which smells like sour hot dogs. This is a light pleasant scent that is much more appropriate for a setting spray and it lasts.
Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,I needed a primer and a setting spray. This does the job. I have extremely sensitive skin and I have had zero issues with this product. I bought a second bottle halfway through the first.

It is lightweight and makes my makeup last forever without looking too dewy or ""expired."" However I was not expecting this bottle to be so small. I guess I should have paid attention to the ounces when purchasing... my bottle only lasted about a month and a half. I am definitely going to re-purchase, but hopefully with more volume!"

This is so quick and easy to use - but more importantly IT WORKS. My makeup no longer transfers onto clothes and it lasts ALL DAY!!

This one almost feels like you put hair spray on your face but in a good way. If that makes sense. I slept with my makeup on with a nap and woke up with the make up on and not transferred on any of my pillows. Great price and actually works.
Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,Works ok. Holds makeup all day and night. Not too much rub off. But it is sticky and it takes a while to dry and set. Still looking for a better holding spray but this will do for now.

Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,This is as good as much more expensive setting products. Better than some. It’s not tacky or noticeable once it dries. I work 12 hour shifts so by the time I get my face washed My make it has been on my face about 15-16 hours and there isn’t a smudge or smear to be seen.

I read about this setting spray on Brandefy (the best beauty app ever). I tried this new spray tonight at work. It lasted the test. My make up did not budge at all.

Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,Absolute best setting spray ever! Goes on so light with such a good spray nozzle that doesn't shoot a line at you. I went to a wedding today and after dancing and sweating non stop my makeup looked as if I just put it on. I at first didn't like this and bought another brand off Amazon that got rave reviews but I ended up coming back to this one and can't do without it. I'm almost out of my bottle now and will absolutely be buying another!

Milani Make It Last 3 合 1 设置喷雾和底漆 - Prime + Correct + 套装(2.03 液体盎司) 化妆喷漆和底漆 - 持久化妆底漆和喷雾,For my wife ordered this for keeping her makeup from smearing she used it and didn't irritate her skin great product
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"So for any of you wondering I contacted amazon myself to ensure this is not sold by a 3rd party, they source and ship the product themselves and it is authentic. The product inside also smells the exact same. This also does the exact same things its done with my past bottles I've bought directly from the retailer in the Past. This stuff is amazing and gentle."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"My wife probably contributes 500 million a year to the multi-billion dollar face crap industry. She buys a bottle, uses it half-way and buys another bottle of something different. Our porch looks like a Nordstrom's make-up department daily with all the packages we receive. I used this stuff as I do all the face cleaners she buys, and it is absolutely amazing. I do not have acne, but I do get break-outs and this stuff stops it right in it's tracks. I can have a zit in full morph, clean my face with this stuff at night, and when I wake up it's gone. I can honestly say that we are on our third bottle and she agrees. This is the first time in 8 years she has bought 2 bottles of the same product, much less the third. And it's a third of the price of most the shit she buys. Now I may be able to buy a boat in the near future."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,Update) i stopped using for few months and resumed on the same bottle again and it got me even worse rashes and bumps on picture. My skin was flawless before.. TELL ME WHAT YOU GUYS PUT IT IN!!!  Def not authentic. I've been using this for 7 years now and I moved between 4 countries. Never gave me break out or severe dryness or irritation. This one i bought from amazon is only thing that is not authentic. Be aware
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Bought this directly from Amazon. It's the real deal. I bought two bottles of this when I was in France, but was starting to run out, and I am SO glad that they finally are making it available in the US!  Now, regarding the product itself, it works very well as a makeup remover, for both your face and for eye makeup. For those tough eye makeup, some reviews complain that it doesn't work well. It's because you have to be patient and use it correctly. It's not oil-based, so it's not going to slide right off. You need to soak the cotton pad and just hold it against your eyelid, and count to 20 seconds, gently rub it a little, and it will come off. If you don't want to wait, sure, just grab an eye-specific remover, it'll be nice, fast, and easy.  In addition to removing all makeup, this product is great for making adjustments to your makeup if you mess up. Use a qtip, wet it with this product, and dab away at where you made a mistake. Since it's not oil-based, once it's dry, you can go ahead and do your makeup there like nothing ever happened. No need to clean your entire face and start over, just the spot you messed up on."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Just not 100% sure this is authentic. I never purchased this before, but was not impressed. No smell, and seems water based, as in, water. There was a slight soapy foam, however suspicious, I would recommend to purchase from a reliable dealer."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Wow! Just wow. I’ve recently decided to overhaul my entire skincare routine because I just don’t feel like I can continue to justify $30+ for every, single thing I use which is on average 4-5 products every morning and night. I have oily-combination skin that has near constant blackheads (Nose to upper cheek area), occasional whitehead, and the rare cystic pimple. Bioderma Sensibio H2O is my most recent edition. I tried micellar water about 2-3 years ago and HATED how oily my face was following using it. If I had used Bioderma Sensibio H2O instead of the awful Garnier stuff I tried, I would’ve written this review 2-3 years ago. What most people with oily, acne-prone skin fail to realize is that we need to treat our skin as sensitive skin. This means we need gentle, minimal ingredient cleaners that don’t strip your skin of its natural protective barrier. So, that hardcore, oil-busting cleanser your using needs to be trashed ASAP. When you overcorrect oily skin, it actually becomes OILIER! Excess oil is actually a defensive response from your skin telling you that your being too aggressive with your skincare choices. I know it feels backwards to read that, but TRUST ME. It’s true. This is where this stuff SHINES. I use it as a part of a double cleansing method. I use this to completely remove my makeup by applying it to a reusable bamboo cotton pad (I can’t justify that much daily waste, so I went reusable). I do it about 2x until the pad comes away clean. Then I wash my face with the stuff I’ve used for years. It’s hard to explain, exactly, what happens when I use this other than it’s freaking pure magic. My face feels fresh, dewy, and sooooo dang soft. I’ve noticed that since I’ve added this product, specifically, that my serums and moisturizers absorb much, much better and quicker. I’ve even noticed my pores looking smaller over the past 3 days. It’s not caused me to break out. In fact, I think it’s possibly been reducing some of my current acne. I honestly never thought I’d love a product that cost me less than $15 this much, but I do. If there’s one product you choose to add to your routine, pick this. Because it’s formulated for sensitive skin, everyone can benefit from it. Do yourself a favor and buy this already!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I wanted to share my review right away because of the way it’s packaged. Other, older reviews mentioned concerns about receiving fake product. This came packaged with a top that doesn’t unscrew (or at least I haven’t been able to do so) and with a safety tab you have to pop open before opening the top. I included pictures to show that. The first one is just the top; the second shows how the tab looks when I’ve started to lift it, I case it wasn’t obvious what I meant in the review or in the first picture. So if anyone is concerned about receiving fake product, it seems there are measures in place to prevent that. As for the product, so far I’m really happy! I could tell a difference right away between this and the Garnier version I had been using previously. I’ll change my review if that opinion changes later, but I wanted to review quickly because of the previous reviews mentioning fraud."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This is an easy yet very effective way to remove makeup/sunscreen. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this works wonderfully. I use this as my first step. (I wash my face afterwards with cleanser.) It is crazy how different my skin feels after I started doing this 'double cleanse'. To those of you who think a double cleanse isn't necessary: Try this. You will see and feel the difference! I don't use a lot of makeup, especially after COVID/masks on all the time. I just use tinted moisturizer and eyeliner. But adding this one step before washing my face has made me see what truly clean skin looks and feels like. There is no scent, and nothing harsh enough to affect my annoyingly reactive skin. Love it."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I love watching Lisa Eldridge’s YouTube videos…she’s a popular makeup artist who works on photo shoots for a lot of the big magazines. She very often uses Bioderma as a makeup remover. I was intrigued, but did research on websites I trust to see if it was safe and non-irritating. It was listed as a safe and effective makeup remover, so I got my own bottle and tried it out. Bioderma is great at removing all kinds of makeup, including waterproof mascara (I soak a cotton pad in Bioderma and place it on my lashes for a few minutes to help waterproof mascara dissolve away). It’s never irritated my skin or eyes. It’s a great value fir the amount of product you get in the 16.7 oz bottle, and it lasts me for months. The pumping dispenser lid is handy for getting the product onto a cotton pad without any mess."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,Made me break out around my nose. Not a fan of this product will stick with simple brand.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Play Video  I definitely like this micellar water. It’s gentle and removes makeup way better than any other product that’s on the market. The only thing I regret is not getting the regular cap. This push top cap is a nice feature, but I feel like it I went through very fast and think that type of cap wastes product when there’s times you don’t need that much on the cotton pad. I will be purchasing again only with the regular top. Other than that, great product. Highly recommend!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Note, if you want the pump top bottle (sometimes costs more than the ""refill"" bottles with plain cap with a hole) really look at the picture and description of what you are buying, or you'll end up with one without a pump top.  I really like the pump top. You do need to use a pad with it and place it in the center before pressing down. Hold the pad on it well, it tends to spatter a bit of micellar water if you don't have the pad on it well. If I'm doing a quick morning cleanse (vs evening with makeup or sunscreen) one pump and one pad is more than enough. (For pads I recommend Intrinsics 407300 Petite Silken Wipes, I usually cut one of those in half to use.)  I have super sensitive, reactive skin that doesn't tolerate a lot. I have to be very careful with what I use. I'm able to use this without having to rinse and I get no redness or irritation. Trying to remove eye-makeup with it, without rinsing I do find is a bit much (more near the eye than a quick wash) and I do prefer to rinse my face if I've done that. I use this mostly as a quick morning or evening (on days I didn't wear makeup or sunscreen) or after the shower quick cleanse.  I have trouble with Garnier and other micellear waters I've tried being too harsh. They have to be rinsed quickly or they burn or sting. They often sting while on your face before getting them rinsed off. While I like to use Cerave Micellar water as a toner (also love Cerave Toner) it has too much niacinamide to be comfortable as a wash. This performs much better.  I'm going to stick with this as my micellar water and skip (after I use up) other brands I have to rinse. I do think that for makeup I do better with a face wash, or even better with Albolene cream (more petrolium based than cream) followed up with a face wash (Cerave regular vs hydrating or Zapzyt with sacylic acid).  It's a great quick cleanse or step after cleansing. But for me it's not going to be all I need or remove all my makeup or sunscreen by itself. It's great if I'm tired or in a rush but the next morning I find I have ""raccoon eyes"" that I didn't go to bed with (from eye makeup tightine fallout it didn't remove, I need something like Albolene that I can rub in my waterline more.).  This is fairly gentle on the eyes, but I prefer Albolene to really get all my eye makeup off and it never stings. This one if you have to rub can sting a little on the eyes. Just don't expect this to be your sole makeup remover if you wear mascara or eyeliner. It's a great final step or quick morning step, just not all you'll need to get all your makeup off."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用, I developed a nerve condition that involves the sensory nerves of the face. The meds I take made my skin texture change and I couldn't use regular soap to clean my face. I found this product and decided to try it. It worked. The best part you don't have to rinse it off. Less friction on an already sensitive area. I suggest using Bioderma Sensibio H2O for sensitive skin. No fragrance and extra stuff to add to your already sensitive skin. I use it every morning and at night to cleanse my face. No fuss no muss. Keeps your skin moisturized and no scents to worry with.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Can’t say enough great things about Sensibio H2O. It’s very gentle on my hypersensitive skin and extremely soothing. I use it once or twice a day - a few drops on two premium cotton pads followed by lukewarm water. I’ve been using it for a week and the result is unbelievable. No more blackheads, pimples, redness, large pores and tight skin. When it comes to skincare, I only use the best of the best. I’d used the expensive Lamer the cleansing micellar water right before purchasing this Sensibio and now I’ve permanently said goodbye to my almost full bottle of lamer cleansing water. Before Lamer, I also tried almost every best skincare brands like Chantecaille, Eve Lom (quite good, actually), Amorepacific, Omorovicza, Darphin, Kiehl’s, Aesop, Avene, Aveda, Fresh, Kate Somerville, La Prairie, SKII (the worst experience I’ve ever got), Obagi (great, gentle on sensitive skin), Neostrata and many more. I don’t usually write reviews but now I feel like I have to. Everyone and every skin condition is different. Now that I no longer need to look for any better face cleanser again in my life. To me this is the ONE and the BEST."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Desde hace muchos años uso Bioderma Sensibio H2O y Bioderma Sensibio AR por indicación del médico dermatólogo, ya que tengo la piel muy sensible con tendencia a rojeces y soy muy alérgica. Es lo único que uso, los recomiendo ampliamente. He leído en los comentarios que algunas personas se enjuagan la cara luego de la limpieza con Bioderm Sensibio H2O y eso es un error, pues luego de su uso queda una capa cubriendo la piel, para su beneficio. No lo enjuaguen. Otras comentan que les irrita los ojos. Como cuando usan cualquier otro producto, cierren bien sus ojos, puede irritarlos, no es agua potable. A mí me va muy bien con ellos, no he tenido ningún problema. Espero les sea útil mi comentario y que los productos les sienten bien . Saludos."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I'm a lazy gal, I hate washing my face at the sink, plus my face gets all red and irritated. Who needs that? I use this morning and night (shower midday after workout) with a full fledged skincare routine. I've been using micellar water for years but... American brands.... yeesh 🙄. Most of them hardly remove makeup at all. My previous HG was CeraVe. It was really the only option I could find that worked to fully remove the lightest smidge of foundation. I always had my eye on Bioderma since I first heard of micellar water, and finally decided to give it a shot. Wow! It is twice as good at removing makeup. Not irritating at all and I have to use less product/cotton pads. I will never go back to American brands after this experience."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Absolutely amazing! I don’t know why people are suspicious of this product when it seems like water with a tiny bit of soap. Have they used this type of product before? They pretty much all resemble water with a drop of soap... until you use them.  I wear all washable makeup, except for my eyeliner pencil and it all wipes away super easily and gently. To get the eyeliner and mascara out from the lash line, I hold a cotton or with 4 pumps of the product on my eye for about 30 sec. All other areas of makeup are visibly gone on the first pass. This product doesn’t irritate my eyes, but I feel a *very tolerable* discomfort if I accidentally rub it into my eye by accident. I love not having to scrub hard at my eyes, lashes and brows to remove makeup completely. After all, us ladies love having our full lashes and brows, not scrubbing them off!  I don’t trust that this is going to kill bacteria, for my fellow acne prone adults out there. I will use this after washing my face or rubbing with alcohol or a toner, as it leaves my face feeling perfectly balanced, moisturized and fresh.  As much as I love this, I probably won’t be buying from Amazon again. I found the exact same product at Costco, twice the amount for half the price I spent here. That’s roughly 25 cents an oz, compared to roughly a dollar an oz I paid on Amazon."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,not for me...did not take off eye make-up and left skin feeling tight
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I realize that skincare products work differently on everyone's different skin, but this cleanser is really incomparable to any other I have used to date. I've been using for the past two years now, prior to that I used the Liz Earle daily cleanser and toner which I found worked very well on my skin too, but decided on a change and come to prefer this for just how clean and discrete it feels on the skin. I'm super aware of any feeling of residue being left on my skin, and I love this for the total lack of stickiness. I have relatively 'normal' skin, sometimes a little dry and the odd spot here or there but no major irritation. I find that this cleanser moisturizes in a very natural way and really clears up any pimples much faster than I've experienced with other products. Just recently I tried a different toner with properties that are known to help reduce pigmentation. This isn't a huge concern but I was curious to see how it might work, however I really didn't find it as soothing or just generally wonderful for everyday use as this. I keep and will keep coming back to it and this recent experience has prompted me to write this review after using for so long! It find that it cleans so well and gently without stripping my skin. There is no scent which I appreciate. I think the price is also more than reasonable, for how long a bottle lasts - 500ml can last me up to 6 months with everyday use."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"LOVE the pump design. Makes it convenient and easy to use my already beloved Bioderma Micellar Water for Sensitive skin. This brand was recommended by my dermatologist. It is gentle and great at removing makeup (including waterproof makeup) and dirt from the day, but it is still gentle on sensitive skin. I have very fry skin and sensitive eyes due to an autoimmune disease, and many things cause a reaction or can easily break me out. This does not. Highly recommend. NOTE: when traveling, if you don’t want to buy the small travel size bottle, buy a small 3 oz or small empty spray bottle and fill that with your Micellar Water and spray it onto your cotton pads. Super easy!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"No tingle, no burning, no scent, no skin tightness. Just fresh, clean skin. It doesn't leave any type of residue on your skin, and does not make it feel tight or sticky afterward. Your face is clean & ready for any other products.  I love to use this to freshen up my skin during the day, since it really doesn't leave any buildup like some other toners or micellar waters.  My skin is very sensitive to certain things, but not others, and I've had no luck with a bunch of other products for sensitive skin, even things meant for babies. This one truly works for sensitive skin and doesn't irritate my eye area.  It's great for taking off makeup also - but I do NOT wear waterproof mascara, so I can't say whether it would take that off or not. It does remove my waterproof eyeliner very well.  I have also used this on dry wipes to create my own wipes for freshening up after exercise. Works great for that also!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"A huge goal of mine is to be more gentle with my face, especially around my eyes. I have a habit of being way to rough around my eye area, especially when I use makeup remover wipes. This product is amazing! I have very sensitive skin and it didnt bother me or my eyes at all. It's so mild and soft, but extremely effective. Alot of makeup removers leave behind makeup still. This one takes absolutely everything off, and there is no need to scrub or be rough. It's like magic honestly. It's the only thing I've tried that gets all of my mascara off. I've heard amazing things about this product and I'm so happy I finally bought it. I wish I would've bought the bigger size bottle! Ladies, this is the best makeup remover I have ever used. And I've tried alot of them. I'm really into makeup, and skincare is becoming more of a top priority for me. Using this product is my very first step in my nightly face routine now. I didnt expect it to be this good! Five stars well earned!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I'm 42 and I have super annoying skin. It's sensitive, seasonally dry, prone to hormonal breakouts AND I get dermatitis around my mouth and nose from some products. It's the WORST. With the exception of one small natural brand that went out of business (boo), I have had trouble with every other micellar water I've tried--including Simple, Acure, Burt's Bees and all the Garnier formulas. Some burn, some aggravate my dermatitis, some make me breakout. UGH.  This product seems to be the magic formula for me! I've been using it to ""wash"" my face at night on days when I'm not wearing makeup (which is like 90% of the time). When I do wear foundation, I use this to remove the makeup and then I wash my face with a cleanser that I use in the morning. There's no rhyme or reason to my method, but it seems to be working for me! Also... it truly is FRAGRANCE FREE. I have the nose of a bloodhound and there's truly no scent in this stuff!  I try to use natural products exclusively, but tried this because the ingredient list is short and generally safe... and I haven't found anything totally natural that works for me. It does contain cetrimonium bromide, PEG-6 caprylic/capric glycerides and propylene glycol, which is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. According to EWG's strict guidelines, they're NOT terribly worrisome ingredients, but they can cause allergic reactions in some people. (I'm assuming that those ingredients are also the cause of the unpleasant chemical taste that's left on my lips after I use it.) :/ These ingredients are definitely not a deal breaker for me because it works so well, but I wanted to mention it for those of you who may have seriously SERIOUS allergies to chemicals.  Even if you do have a lot of sensitivity to products, but you aren't sure that any of those ingredients is definitely culprit... I say get a travel size bottle and TRY IT! I'm really glad I gave it a shot! It's great stuff!  PS: If you're interested in learning about product ingredients, EWG is a reliable, trustworthy source. Google ""EWG Skin Deep"" to check it out! (I am not affiliated with them. I just love the service.)"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This stuff is magic. What else can I say. I don't know how but somehow this stuff can:  - Find all the day's dust, makeup, goop on your face that soap cannot touch. After a shower, this can still find plenty of unwanted things on the face. It's like a dirt detective! - Moisturize. For someone with combination skin, this is the only thing you need on your face before you sleep and your face wakes up feeling so hydrated. - No scent. It's not like the unscented products that still have a bland or plastic smell. This really has next to no smell at all, which is great for all noses.  Little goes a long way. Great value. Buy it!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Holy grail product for me -- nothing like it.  It easily removes waterproof eye makeup. I can't use the bi-phase formulas because they irritate my skin, and this is the only product I found that works for me and doesn't irritate my skin.  Also, it doesn't sting your eyes!  Pro tip: unlike many other removers, it DOESN'T work instantly. You have to soak something like a cloth with the liquid, then press it lightly over the makeup to be removed and wait 30 seconds to a minute. It will wipe right off with no struggle. However, if you immediately try to wipe the makeup away with the dampened cloth without waiting, it won't remove the makeup. Dunno why that works, but so it is!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I double cleanse each night. First using this, then with my face wash. My skin hasn’t had any issues and looks better than it has in years. I don’t have a ton of time for nightly skin routine, but this along facewash, a good moisturizer and retinol has done wonders for me. I have sensitive skin and it is dry in the winter. A dermatologist recommended this that I follow on Instagram and I’m glad she did!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I tried to is a year ago and HATED it.. recently my skin has been very dry and I decided to repurchase to use as an AM cleanser. The trick I found to loving this is rinsing it off after I apply it then follow with a moisturizer. I’ve been using for a month now and my skin is the best it’s been in my entire life and I’ve struggled with acne for 10+ years. I had one breakout in the last month… one. I used to get one a day! I’m obsessed now! If you don’t like it try rinsing with water after you apply it to remove the residue.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This is a must have at home. I'm on my 3rd bottle. I use it every weekday to remove my makeup as soon as I come home from work. It feels like water that actually removes makeup, even my mascara (not waterproof) without leaving black residue along my lash lines. There's no sticky feeling afterwards or eye/skin irritation. There's no scent to me. There's some skin tightness but I think that's expected, and I always moisturize afterwards.  I bought my first bottle from Beautylish, and my other 2 orders from Amazon. Based on other reviews, I was afraid it may be a fake, but I made sure I ordered the ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"". I believe its authentic because it works."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Great for sensitive skin. It doesn't leave a greasy film. I live in a dry climate and use RX tretinoin and I felt zero irritation or dryness from this product. It's very gentle. I do not wear any makeup, so I cannot speak to how well this would remove mascara or foundation. It does a great job in removing waterproof sunscreen.  Update** Unfortunately, I have had to return this due to the fact it has to be applied with a cotton pad and that has caused major irritation to my skin. The ingredients are great and if you can tolerate swiping your face with a cotton pad, this will be great for you."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Usually micellar water leaves me feeling like I've got a layer of sticky stuff on my face. Not so with Sensibio. It removes all my makeup (nothing waterproof, but I do use sunscreen) quickly and easily without burning my eyes or making my skin itchy. I don't detect any scent. I usually rinse or use a cleanser after anyway, but even if I don't, this feels perfectly comfortable with no real dryness. I would not call it moisturizing but I tend to be very dry. It is very gentle for sensitive skin."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I have a very sensitive skin and most micellar waters don’t work for me. So i really really like this product, my skin burns when I use most cleansing agents and this one is so far does the job of make up remover and cleaning up the face. I use it on a daily basis have been using it for a couple of months now and no issues seen. I have a subscription of this eve 6 months.  PS: I gave 5 stars for scent because it doesn’t have a string scent and very very mild scent that can go as unrecognizable. I prefer it that way"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I have used various makeup removing wipes and solutions in the past, but this Bioderma Sensibo H20 is simply the best: 1) Less expensive 2) Lasts longer 3) Can use less or more as needed (unlike wipes) 4) Simply works better (especially for eyes) 5) Little to no irritation (don't use too much or it will burn a little if it gets in the eye) 6) No odor 7) Removes shadow, liner, & mascara on both eyes with 1 cotton pad!  I am sold...already bought a 2nd bottle.  PS...I don't use ""waterproof"" mascara or liner, so I can't speak to how this product would do with that. But, it removes non-waterproof eye makeup easily and quickly!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I have really difficult skin that breaks out with the littlest change. I have been using Proactive for years and haven’t been using a make up remover but knew I needed to. I have used the product two nights in a row and I am impressed with the removal and the fact that it seems like it’s so gentle it almost feels like I am just using water. There’s no strong smell to this and it melts my make up off easily and leaves my face smooth and hydrate and doesn’t leave that tight feeling other products can leave behind. I haven’t had any break outs and hoping that using this with proactive I will be ok because I really like this product
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This doesn’t simply clean and tone your skin, it soothes it without that tight dry feeling. I even sometimes use this instead of cleanser and water because it’s so gentle and noticeably removes every impurity of my cotton pads are any indication. This is also a must use when you wear tinted sunscreen. Not my oil cleaner comes close to getting it all off at night but any left over is completely eradicated by a couple of swipes of bioderma."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Alright so I’m such an advocate for good skincare that I can’t believe it took me so long to add this into my routine. Totally, completely understand the hype now. I was using makeup wipes before to remove makeup, and boy is this a total game changer. My skin not only feels so much cleaner after with this, but it’s actually noticeably softer and wayyyy less dried out. I can 100% say this has also improved my issues with acne, there was a noticeable difference in the first week that carried on to this point(have been using for about 2 months now), so I have to say: If you have sensitive, dry skin like me and feel the need to do lots of research before adding a product to routing- stop your research here. I just wish I knew about this sooner."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,my dermatologist recommended this product and it has transformed my skin! All the bumps on my forehead are gone and I feel so moisturized. Before when I washed my face with typical brands and my face always felt tight afterwards.. I also get acne from underchest sweat and I used this there and it cleared everything up! I am about to finish my first bottle but I noticed a difference after a few days. Halfway through the bottle my bumps were all gone. Just buy it!!!!!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"If you're going to use the micellar water this is the one. As a skincare enthusiast this is my ride or die. I have found ones in the drug store or big box stores just do not do what this one does. This was the first micellar I ever used and will be the last. Great for sensitive skin takes everything off mostly on the first round where others like Garnier do not. A must have staple, especially when traveling or flying."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I purchased the entire Bioderma package (AR Cream, Micellar water, cleansing soap, sunscreen and Serum) I use it 2 times a day, I still do not go to a Dermatologist I am waiting for my appointment due to Covid They have a long wait, I decided to buy the line Bioderma by my own decision and some recommendations right here, definitely the moisturizing on my face is better, the Rosacea has decreased but not as I would like 😔, I leave photos of how I started and how I have progressed in 2 months of use."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I decided to try this micellar cleanser because I stated to see similar products everywhere and wanted to understand what the hype was about. It turns out this brand is regarded as starting the trend, so I thought it best to start here. I like this product because it doesn't strip the skin, you don't have to use water afterward, and it really leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed. I use it to remove makeup, but honestly I don't wear makeup everyday, so mostly I use it as a gentle cleanser - when I don't feel like doing my extended skin care routine. I've tried other ""no rinse"" cleansing waters and milks since, and I don't like them as much as this. I will be keeping this as a staple in my beauty routine."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This will be my new go/to make up remover. I have very sensitive skin and had found every make up remover to be way too greasy, even the most light weight and oil free formulas. The only product I ever liked was Almay Oil Free liquid and it’s being discontinued. This product is light on the skin, it soothes and feels refreshing as you wipe off make up. Removes mascara easily, even waterproof. Can’t believe I fjj in Bally found an alternative and I actually like it way better than even Almay. Will be purchasing again"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I’ve been using this product regularly for 5+ years and will never be without even if I try other similar Products. Nothing compares to this. Almost no scent which I appreciate as having sensitive and eczema skin. Effectively moves makeup and I also use this as a gentle morning face wash.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Sensibio is great, and deserves all the fame and praise everyone heaps on it. It removes makeup VERY quickly and thoroughly, leaves zero residue, doesn't irritate or dry the skin, never burns your eyes, and the price is amazing. It's the perfect makeup remover.  My only minor criticism is that I'm a longtime user of Koh Gen Do Cleansing Spa Water, which removes makeup just as well as Sensibio but is more nourishing to the skin. The KGD doesn't leave a residue, but it leaves my skin softer and more moisturized from the natural plant and herbal extracts. I prefer the feel of the KGD, but it costs $51 vs Bioderma's $15, so...yeah. Next time, I'll try Bioderma Hydrabio instead of Sensibio to see if it mimics the nourishing feel of KGD spa water."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I've been using this product for a while and decided to re-order it on amazon. They're the same quality as the ones I purchased in the store. It's super effective in getting makeup (especially eye makeup) off while not stripping the skin at all!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Double cleansing is a staple of my nighttime routine. I used to use Garnier, and while it does work pretty well, switching to Bioderma has helped my skin even more. It's hard to explain but it makes my skin feel hydrated after using it (not oily & not stripped). It works really well and this size bottle lasts a long time. So despite the slightly higher price, it is worth it for me."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This micellar water gets so much hype for a reason. It truly is the best micellar water on the market. But as with any product that gets so much press, this inspires a lot of fakes. Be very careful when buying Sensibio H2O online, including here on Amazon. Please make sure the seller is actually Amazon, or another Bioderma-authorized retailer. Don't let a fake convince you this product is mediocre, which is what almost happened to me!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I used not put on makeup very often because I felt too lazy to remove makeup. This water make makeup remove so easy that I began to put on makeup all days hat I have to go work and school. Another water I used were not able to remove eyelash mascara, but this one clean it all, you don’t need an extra step for eye makeup remover. (Only if you are use super strong water proof mascara, you may need oil base eye makeup remover for extra help). Overall it’s amazing and make you life easy! Try it!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,This is the first step in my nighttime skincare routine. It is great at removing my makeup and sunscreen before washing my face. I have oily skin so this is better for me than a cleansing balm and I would recommend this to anyone else with oily skin.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I was using disposable makeup remover wipes, then washing with bar soap, then moisturizing. This does all three without drying my skin, and my skin is thanking me for it already! I don’t really notice a scent either, and this works great for removing waterproof eye makeup, even for a contact wearer with sensitive eyes and skin! I’ve stopped using other products other than a night-time moisturizer to remove my makeup and clean my face."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I used the product to take off makeup and clean my face before bed. It is a great product, does not irritate my sensitive skin and acne prone skin, and doesn’t cause redness or breakouts. I was using thayers witch hazel and although it was good at first, it began to cause severe redness and irritation in my skin.  I have noticed that it does seem to be drying to the skin, but that is the only downfall, and realistically it could be weather related. Otherwise works very well and I would highly recommend for sensitive skin, redness, acne. I am either going to re-order the same formula or their moisturizing one in the future."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,Bought this to be the first of a double cleanse skin routine on Hyram’s recommendation. I use it on a reusable cotton pad to remove my makeup before cleansing with a water based cleanser. I’m really enjoying it so far! I only got a small one just in case but so far I believe I’ll be repurchasing a bigger bottle once I finish the small one. It doesn’t have a strong smell which is good and it’s gentle enough to remove eye makeup.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,This micellar water is very different than the norm. It leaves your skin so clean feeling and moisturized without being sticky. It also doesn’t bother my eyes while removing my eye makeup which other micellar waters sometimes do. It’s the best I’ve ever used. I use it day and night and I love it!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,Highly recommend for cleansing your face. Doesn’t dry your face out and great for sensitive skin. I have rosacea so I am very cautious with what I use on my face.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I find it difficult to remove daily SPF with just a facial cleanser (even if I cleanse twice) and I can’t use oil cleansers because they break me out. I’m so happy I tried this product. Pour a little onto a cotton round and gently wipe your face, the SPF will be gone leaving a clean fresh feeling. I cleanse after that with my regular facial cleanser and now I finally feel clean!!! I’ve been using for a couple of months now and this has not caused any break outs - I might even say it’s improved my complexion a little! Try it out you’ll love it."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"If you have used this cleansing water before, you would love the price and size of it from amazon prime. I usually buy the same size of product around $15 but i got it the cheapest on amazon! I saw couple bad reviews on this and someone said it was a fake product. So I looked up on online for it and mine was actually a real one. pros: Easy to use, Mild on skin, works great. cons : you will need to use lots of cotton pads, it contains PEG in front line of ingredients, so recommended to wash with water after you use this(if you are using it every day;), maybe not perfect match for dry skin( you can try hydro- one from same brand )"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I have dry, sensitive and “mature” skin. I use this to get off the grime of the day and before my nighttime routine starts. I don’t “wash” my face with water everyday so this is my cleanser. Better than a toner, no alcohol."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I love that this has very little scent and does not create any burning sensation on my skin like regular astringents do. It removes makeup very well and is not overly drying. My only complaint is that the cap looks like it should twist off, but it doesn’t. I wanted to get a bigger bottle and use it to refill this little bottle to leave on my cabinet or use for travel. Since I couldn’t get the cap off, I can’t reuse it. Not a huge deal since the product itself is great, the bottle is just kind of annoying."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Pretty good size bottle that you get. The product itself I really like. I don’t use it by itself normally, I use it after I wash my face so I can take off every last bit of makeup on my face before I move on to the rest of my skincare routine. I haven’t broken out by it and I have sensitive skin. It doesn’t have any sort of fragrance. Will definitely continue to purchase in the future."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Love this brand! I purchased the SK-II essence recently. I was very disappointed in the scent. It smelled like fish sauce you get at a vitenamese restaurant. I don’t feel it did any better of a job on my skin then this product. I know this is more of a cleaning waterthan an essence. But, the smell was awful. I purchased the SK-II directly from Macys. It was not a knock-off. I have been using this brand for years and will continue to use this for many more years. It’s a great product that has any smell, works wonders, and never bothers my skin! Much better product for the price. The SK-II was such a disappointment. I know essence and Micelle solution are for different steps in the skin care routine, but that smell makes me want to skip that step all together. I thought I could use the SK-II as a Michelle water solution... no way! This product never disappoints for me!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Great product. I have combination skin and have been trying to learn ways to clense and treat all parts of my face. I recently started to double clense and realized that oil clensers were making the oily parts of my face worse, so I started using this a s a first clense and love it! I have sensitive skin, so I was pleasantly surprised when I did not have a reaction to this. Works well with the oily parts of my face as well as the dry sensitive parts."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I use this every time I wash my face. It's a ""must"" for me. It feels like it keeps my face clean at the same time preps my skin for whatever moisturizing products I am using at the time. It also gently cleans my eye make-up off with the use of a cotton cleaning pad. The bottle lasts a long time and I highly recommend it."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Honestly I will never use makeup wipes again to clean my makeup. 2-3 Cotton rounds and you don’t even have to wash your face after. Apply makeup directly after or just go to bed. I’ve had no breakouts, or irritations. My skin is smooth and glowing the next day."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This stuff is incredible. I’ve been using it for about 4 months now and am just about to reach the end of the bottle. I use a pretty generous amount every time I remove my makeup, and I’m the type of person who wears makeup every day in non-covid times (nowadays probably 4 times a week). I LOVE this and I’m considering just using this for a cleanser and kissing my soap goodbye. I have acne prone skin like you wouldn’t believe, but this has never made me break out."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"The bottle’s a little big to fit in my cosmetics bag, but overall a great product for that leftover eye makeup at the end of the night. It doesn’t burn my eyes and picks up EVERYTHING. It’ll pick up something not noticeable to the naked eye like maybe leftover makeup around the edges of your face or mascara on your lashes. Ingrid Nielsen the YouTuber put me onto this in 2012/13"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This is a keeper! I am very sensitive to scents, and my skin is very sensitive to products. The last eye makeup remover I used made my eyes red. This takes off mascara and all of my makeup so easily! I use cotton pads. I am no longer a waterproof mascara user, so I cannot comment on how it works for that. I love how it works quickly, and my eyes do not feel oily, or itchy, or red."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I really like this stuff!!! I was reading about it on a website and the websites wasn't a company that sold this product& told me to get it on amazon. So I hoped that it was an honest reference and not accompany just trying to make money off their product. I'm a genuine skeptical what can I say lol. They use this stuff once A-day or every other day sometimes instead of washing my face and it makes it so soft!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This removes make up better than anything I've used and doesn't irritate my eyes or skin. I also use it to clean my makeup brushes. Makeup just dissolves off the brushes in no time. Quick rinse, shake off excess water and ready to re-use after air drying."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I've tried Garnier and l'Oreal brands from the American drugstores, and they just don't take makeup off. This one takes EVERYTHING off including mineral sunscreen, without the ridiculous two-step oil-cleanser/water-based cleanser nonsense. I stick this and a pack of cotton rounds by my bed, and it means I actually bother to take care of my skin on those impossibly exhausted nights. It leasn't leave my skin dehydrated, and there's no film or oil left behind. Just clean skin."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This product has revolutionized my skincare routine. It cleans your skin without stripping or drying it. I also love that this product can be used on the eyes and on the skin. It is completely fragrance free, great for sensitive skin and acne. It will not upset your skin; I promise! It removes makeup, including eye makeup, easily, and yet is gentle enough to be used just to clean your bare skin."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I really love and reccomend this stuff!!! Feels great and its quick and easy and cheap. Fell in love instantly. I had pretty yucky skin until I started putting the effort in, and I didnt want to put much in.. this and medicated cleanser and simple moisturizer, my skin is porcelain I couldnt be happier."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I bought a bottle a few months ago and loved it. Thinking all Micellar waters would be the same , I bought a cheaper brand. Used half of it and threw the rest away. I tried another leading brand. Used half of it and threw it away. Nothing compares to Bioderma. It leaves your face feeling clean and so very soft. I purchased some for my 14 year old granddaughter and now find myself buying for her also. She loves it too!! Don't waste your money on other brands. I highly recommend."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Bioderma Sensibio - I learned about this product way too late in life. I have very sensitive skin and have to use a thick gel or cream cleanser or my skin gets a bit raw and irritated. I’m also on the go a lot, which makes purchasing and packing travel products a pain. I love this product. It’s all you need for lazy/busy/travel days. I still follow a full skin care regimen regularly when I’m at home. But I’ve been using only this (since it covers all of the basics) when I’m away from home and it hasn’t bothered me in the least. It’s the best 3-in-1 ever!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I love that this gets my face just as clean as cleanser and water before I got to bed. No water everywhere to clean up, and it's quicker and doesn't wake me up like water washing can do. Love this product, will not use anything else!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Bioderma Sensibo micellar water is widely regarded as the best micellar water around - and for good reason. It's ultra gentle but does the job of removing makeup and grime. It's a great way to make sure your skin is completely clean after showering or washing, and can help cut back on unnecessary cleansing with soap and water. I use it in the mornings instead of washing my face, which can be stripping if done too often, and at night after I shower to make sure all the makeup's off. I've tried a few different micellar waters but not compare. And also, who doesn't like feeling fancy and French?"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,This is the best makeup remover in my 50 years of wearing makeup!!! Love it! Am giving to my sisters and girlfriends for Christmas! First found it at Costco (not there anymore) and now on Amazon. Doesn't hurt skin or dry it out! Did I say I love it? Oh! I use the rectangle cotton wipe thingys from drug store. The applicator is great! You put the cotton thing on the applicator and press down and the water shoots up into the cotton. I pump it a few times to saturate it for mascara. Love It!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This product was love at first swipe! I really, really dislike washing my face at night because I am L-A-Z-Y. The micellar water allows me to wipe my face clean of make-up and ""life grime"" while in bed watching Netflix. And this stuff STELLAR. The amount of face gunk that reveals itself on my cotton pads is...kind of gross really but that is how you know the product is working!  The bottle lasts me for quite some time - about six weeks. I hope you fall in love after your first swipe, too!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I have tried many products for skin care, and both cheap and ridiculously expensive. Of them all, Bioderma Micellar Water and my prescription Tretinoin Cream 0.1% work miracles. Both do what they promise. This Bioderma Micellar Water is a game changer. I promise you your face is not clean until you use it.  All you do is get some soft cosmetic cotton disposable pads, apply a little Bioderma to the pad, and gently cleanse your face. It only takes a tiny bit. I found that no matter what cleanser or scrub I used, I could remove more; the cotton pad with the Bioderma, used immediately after, was grey with grime. No matter what I tried, the pad showed grime on it after I used the Bioderma. It is absolutely the only product I now use to cleanse my face twice daily. I don't even bother with any other cleansers. This Micellar water outperforms any cleanser on the market. And far more gentle on your skin.  You will be amazed at how much gunk and dirt Bioderma will remove. I use several cotton pads with the Bioderma until the last pad is white. I let the Micellar water dry by itself on my face, then use my creams and serums, or apply my makeup. And it also removes makeup like magic. Including the most stubborn mascara and will NOT burn your eyes. Leaves your skin soft, plump, and hydrated. Super gentle."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,This is a good product. Great for sensitive eyes and does a good job of removing makeup. The price increase is absolutely ridiculous though. Similar products by other brands (that work the exact same) only raised their prices pennies. $8 more….I don’t think so!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I love this micellar water! I will not use another brand. It’s on the pricey side but it’s worth it. Especially when you can find the two bottle for $20. I have very sensitive skin and this is gentle on my skin. Unlike garnier, my skin can’t handle their micellar water. I wouldn’t say it’s moisturizing but it’s not drying either. I still use a moisturizer at night once I cleanse."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I was looking for an inexpensive option for taking off make up. I usually use green beauty products only and I like that this doesn’t have harmful chemicals and no scents. It works really well for me as a makeup remover. Might not be the best for tough to remove eye make up but it will certainly get a lot of it off. Also usually have reactions even to more natural brands (cleansers and make up remover type products) and my skin has no issues with this!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I love this stuff. It cleans my mascara and other makeup off easily. ( i don't use waterproof) if you get it in your eyes, it doesn't sting badly and rinses off easily for discomfort. I'm on my second bottle! I also love the design of the bottle"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Very gentle micellar water cleanser. I bought this because I started using a prescription retinol and I decided to purchase very gentle, skin friendly products. This helps to remove any extra makeup or to gently cleanse without water. Sometimes I’ll cleanse my face in the morning with only this and then I apply my moisturizer right after. This doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It doesn’t strip the skin but still cleanses well. Very good product."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I saw a lot of reviews of people saying this is not the real Bioderma Sensibio H2O so I didn’t buy it for days. I don’t know what happened with those people but I got a mini bottle just to try it and I love it. I use it after I wash my face and it takes off all the makeup my facial cleanser didn’t get with one cotton pad. It also doesn’t leave my skin feeling irritated to tender. It really is a great product.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,This is my favorite micellar water. I’ve tried many brands. This cleans well an is very mild. No burning like some other brands. I remove my makeup with this on a cotton pad every night.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This brand is gentle and cleans so well I use only this in the morning and after I work out. Unlike some store brands i've used, this micellar water really works well against makeup. I also use the bioderma foam cleanser after my oil cleanser at night and I have had a clear face for more than a month ... which for me felt impossible (I have sensitive, acne prone skin since teens and I'm in my 30s)."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This product is amazing!! Great for sensitive skin. I would greatly recommend it to anyone. I have Rosacea and trying to keep your face clean after a long day can be a little stressful and frustrating. This product doesn't dry skin, removes makeup easily and for daily use. My to go product anytime now!! I give it a 10👌 ☺🤪"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I was surprised how gentle this is on my skin, and how easily it removes makeup. In comparison to my former makeup remover I’m not worried about this burning my eyes; it’s very gentle, can be used multiple times a day, etc. if you need a quick cleanse or bedtime routine this is definetly something to add I have super sensitive and oily skin and this does wonders. No addtl breakouts, oil is under control (BIG TIME)."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I don’t know why I’ve used other products for so long? I just stared to use this stuff! And I LOVE IT!..... doesn’t irritate my skin, ( my makeup remover wipes I was using would leave my face all red ) after using this product I realize how much better it is!..... never going back!......... takes off makeup in seconds, no hard rubbing , comes off with ease !"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I used to buy Sephora brand non-oil based eye makeup remover, but since they've been out of it for months I went in search of a new brand. After many trials of other products which were often oil-based and didn't work for me, I found Bioderma's Micellar Water. It is very gentle, safe for the eyes and remove my makeup flawlessly. I use it just on removing eye makeup and it works great to remove waterproof and non-waterproof mascaras. I highly recommend it."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Overall a very good micellar water,good for sensitive skin, I use this as the 1st step before washing my face with a cleanser & sometimes just use this in the AM and rinse with just water. the only problem I have is not with the product but is the s&h I wish Amazon would do a better job of packing, add a couple of those plastic ""pillows"" in the box, most of the time the bottle cap arrives damaged."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"The only toner and the only makeup remover for my eyes I can use without additional cleansing or water for rinse. This stuff is amazing and I was so happy to hear they shipped directly from Amazon themselves when I saw I couldn't buy this stuff at Ulta or Sephora yet. With the brand being so cheap itself there's no need to go try a dupe of this stuff, just get this stuff!! Even after I double cleanse, this stuff will still draw out sebum and wax when I swipe for toning. It's amazing."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"This product is great I absolutely love it. It made my skin super soft, it feels great on the skin, very Gentle & soothing. It didn’t dry out my skin like most products. I will definitely be purchasing this again."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I'm so glad I made the switch to this for removing makeup. It leaves my face feeling fresh, and I've noticed a decrease in breakouts since using this. I will never go without it now!"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I’ve tried balms and double cleansers and I always come back to this. I use it to break up and heavy makeup/sunscreen/mascara and then go in with my regular cleanser. Purchased the one with the pump. Without the pump the product goes everywhere and it drives my crazy. Pump works and is very convenient.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"I used to use a different drugstore brand of makeup remover wipes, but I was having a lot of dryness and breakouts with very sensitive skin. My dermatologist recommended dropping the wipes and switching to this - I was amazed at how well it cleaned my skin and removed all makeup, dirt and oil. Better yet, I don't need to use any harsh cleansers on my face, my skin condition has improved drastically and my skincare routine has simplified a ton. :)"
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,As someone with very sensitive skin I’m always very hesitant to try a new skin care product. Luckily I got this in a sample size in a giveaway bag and I was so happy I tried it. I use this as my first cleanse and it removes my makeup easily. It would also be perfect for that late night when you don’t want to do your whole skin care routine but you know you can’t go to sleep with your makeup on. And compared to others I’ve tried that’s meant for sensitive skin this definitely removes the makeup better than the others
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,I've searched high and low trying to find a cleanser that doesn't dry out my face and this product is the absolute best. It removes makeup very well and doesn't leave my skin dry. I find that my pores have been a lot less visible on my cheeks and the red irritated spots close to and on my nose are slowly fading. I use morning and evening and add a little moisturizer if I'm going to put make-up on. A definite MUST HAVE!!!
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,This product is gentle but effective at removing high % zinc facial sunscreen.
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Washing my hyper-sensitive skin with gentle cleanser and water left me in a cycle of redness, tiny pimples, and dryness. This stuff is truly effective at removing make-up without irritation, even around the eyes! I have replaced my nightly face washing at the sink with Bioderma micellar water on cotton balls and it's made a huge difference for me. It hasn't cured my rosacea/eczema, but it has reduced the extreme flare-ups."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"Tengo rosacea y com cualquier agua micelar sentía picazón y mi rostro se ponía más rojo de lo usual. En el primer uso de esta agua sentí frescura y limpieza profunda del maquillaje, sin afectar mi cara. Recomendado para pieles ultra sensibles."
Bioderma - Sensibio - H2O 胶束水 - 卸妆洁面乳 - 敏感肌肤适用,"OK I’ve tried Mycellar water in several brands. Practically every beauty brand makes one these days...I keep coming back to Bioderma! this one takes off more gunk and make up even after I’ve removed my makeup with other brands .. ya I did my own test. Mycellar waters are not all the same. More expensive ones don’t work better that I have tried. Other ones that might have cucumber or rose water in it, they irritate my skin so it’s back to this I go."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I had chemo 4 years ago and my lashes grew back very thin. I am constantly buying mascara for fullness or length. This mascara made my lashes soooo long. Even my husband noticed!
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I bought the Maybellone Sky High mascara after I saw it on Instagram and it looked like a possible dupe for the Hourglass Unlocked Mascara which is $29. From looks and appears I definitely feel like this is a dupe for the Hourglass Unlocked mascara and for the money I will definitely will be repurchasing this and forgo the Hourglass mascara.  First, the size and width of the mascara tubes are very similar. It appears that the Maybelline mascara is about 1-2 mm shorter than the hourglass mascara. Like many luxury products the Hourglass component is significantly heavier than the Maybelline mascara which gives it the “luxury” feeling.  The brush application are nearly identical between the two as you can see from one of my images. They both have plastic applicators that are slender with short bristles. The slender applicator with the short bristle makes it easy to grab and lengthen the inner corner lashes that are hard to reach with fatter mascara applicators.  However, the biggest difference between the two mascaras is that the Maybelline mascara head is significantly more flexible than the Hourglass one. Upon application, I found the extreme flexibility in the Maybelline mascara applicator made it very difficult to apply the mascara to the root and push it through to the tip of the lashes. I typically like a mascara wand this isn’t so flexible so I can use the firmness to help push the mascara formula into the roots of the lashes and up to the tips of the lashes. However, due to the flexibility in the wand it was extremely difficult to do this and it took me a while to apply the mascara to get a fanned out effect. Yet, when I finished applying the mascara it looked great.  Once dried the mascara feels the nearly the same when I gently run my finger through my lashes. If anything the Maybelline one feel slightly more tough whereas the Hourglass feels soft to the touch.  I actually did a test and applied the Maybelline mascara on one eye and the hourglass on the other eye and asked my roommates if they noticed any difference and which they liked more. They both said there was very little difference between the two but preferred the Maybelline one because the lashes looked more separated.  Both mascaras make your lashes extremely long and fanned out. They don’t give too much volume which is okay with me because I prefer that look anyways. I know some people don’t like that look but I personally prefer long individual lashes that look like my natural lashes but longer. Both of these mascaras are washable and can be easily be removed with warm water and/or makeup remover. They have identical lasting power too!  In the end, if you’ve been wanting to try the Hourglass Unlocked Mascara and it’s not in your budget I would highly recommend you get this one instead give the Maybelline is $9 and the Hourglass Unlocked is $29. It’s a really a great dupe and I’m so glad that Maybelline came out with this mascara given they you’re supposed to change out your mascara every 3 months. I don’t feel as bad if I lose this mascara or it’s passed it’s shelf life given the price."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Okay so what I requested to review and what is pictured in the product listing doesn't seem to be the same item I received. I've included a picture of the bottle because what I received is great and 10/10 wil hunt down and buy again, especially at a price point lower than $10. This is better than some of the more expensive mascaras I've purchased or had the opportunity to review. I included a picture of one eye with it and the other without it (sorry my eye is watering in the picture) and it's obvious that this works well and its buildable. I really like the product I received and have every intention of buying again!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",Feels like a thrive mascara dupe. It really holds up well. I think I found my new mascara.
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",New ride or die! I'm pretty sure this is a dupe for thrive mascara... I've got both but this one looks better on. Maybelline ALWAYS has the best mascaras! Highly recommend!
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","This mascara is so great!! In my opinion it is a dupe for the Thrive Causemetics mascara and honestly even better. This mascara lengthens your lashes so well, it looks like you have on false lashes. Maybelline has some of the best affordable mascaras and this one does not disappoint. The mascara did not flake or smudge on me at all. I put it on in the morning (including bottom lashes) and wore it until 11:00pm and it still looked great. This will be my new holy grail mascara at such an affordable price. I highly recommend!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","When I put this on, I loved it, it seems like a dupe for the Benefit Bad Gal Bang, my fav! Made my lashes look so long but after a few mins I noticed the chemical smell burned my eyes a little , after a little bit I didn't notice it anymore. When I washed it off, it started to burn around my eyes and eye lids. It's been 3 days and my eye lids are still sensitive and still burn, especially when I wash my face, or my face gets wet."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Mascara clumps like crazy and not true waterproof, it flakes off after awhile. So disappointed since I really like Maybelline mascaras. Won’t purchase this again."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I’m weird with mascara. I have very light eyelashes so I require multiple coats to fully cover them. Usually when layering mascara it starts to make my eyelashes clump together and it gets flakey. This stuff literally covers all of my eyelashes, including the very short corner ones. It is easy to remove. And it doesn’t flake. It’s buildable and long lasting."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",Wow! I've always loved Maybelline mascara and this is no different. I love the length and the wear of the formula. Great mascara. Easy to remove as well.

I always have the problem of raccoon eyes after washing off mascara even if I wash multiple time... this mascara has been easy to wash off. I love the length and separation, that this mascara provides and it is affordable! My BFF commented on my mascara last night when we had dinner so that was a great confirmation , so this is now my new favorite!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Play Video  So I expected this mascara to make a dramatic change to the length of my lashes but that didn't happen. Lol. 😂 It's water & smudge proof, so you can cry all you want and be rest assured you won't have mascara all over your face. You can also go swimming. It gave me more volume than length. It's very easy to apply, so it's good for beginners. Try not to apply too much too quick because it dries very fast, and excessive product application will give you a less natural look. I think I like the waterproof nature more than anything. It is really really water proof, I'd definitely buy it again!!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I bought a tube of this mascara from Amazon but got impatient - so I went to Walgreens and bought the exact same mascara so I could use it while I waited for the other one. The one from Walgreens is slightly different (and better) in my opinion.  Not sure why there was a difference between the mascara and the quality - considering Maybelline is the seller on Amazon, not some random company. But here are the differences that I noticed between the two:  1) the biggest difference was the packaging. The one from Amazon - the label didn’t match up like the other (see my picture) and the tube was harder to close in general. 2) the formula from the Amazon one seems different. It’s super wet and almost feels runny and watery. The one from Walgreens is thicker and not as messy. 3) lengthening! The one from Walgreens seems to lengthen way more than the Amazon one. The one from Amazon just seemed so wet that it wasn’t picking up any mascara to lengthen my lashes. The Walgreens one was thick enough to pull what mascara I already applied on my eyelashes to create a lengthening effect.  Overall: I paid a few dollars more at Walgreens for this mascara, but considering the quality from the Amazon purchase.... I will always be buying this mascara from Walgreens from now on. I would consider ordering from Amazon again if I was in a pinch and couldn’t find it in a drug store... but it wouldn’t be my first choice!!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Wow!! My lashes have never been longer! Definitely worth the hype! Pictured is two coats. I usually use a primer and they look even better! You do have to wiggle the wand to make sure it doesn’t clump because the formula is a bit wet, although this is normal for a new tube of mascara. 10/10!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I LOVE THIS MASCARA!!!! Like, it’s so good that I think I like it more than Better Than Sex (and obviously this is a better price too). I think it has the same effect as Better Than Sex at first, but I think this one wears longer! In this pic, I had been wearing it for about 4 hours already and my eyelashes still looked amazing!! Keep in mind, I do also have very hooded/deepset eyes so I didn’t curl my lashes or anything. I also didn’t use it on the bottom lashes because I like my top lashes to be more defined. But yes, 10/10 recommend this mascara over anything. I like it better than Too Faced (Better Than Sex), I like it better than Tarte (Big Ego), I like it better than Marc Jacobs (Velvet Noir), I like it better than Maybelline Lash Stiletto, I like it better than Elf (3-in-1), everything. If you’re indecisive, get it."

I’m also worried I won’t be able to get it since the word is out on how great this is! I’ve been wearing extensions for years, but my lashes were taking a beating so I’ve discontinued them. I read a review on this mascara and decided to try it, I was not disappointed! This is seriously the best mascara I’ve ever used. I recently ordered the waterproof and was happy with it as well, it also wasn’t that hard to remove. My once skimpy lashes are now fantastic looking!"

I hate putting on false lashes. Ain't nobody got time for that all the time! My daughter asked me to order her mascara and I typed in Maybelline, this was the first one mascara to pop up! And now my lashes do the same! Without my heated eye lash curler, without several layers, without a dusting of powder, nothing! But a couple, literally 2 coats, and what! Where did those lashes come from! The mascara is a little more on the fluid side than I'm used too. There's no smell. It will definitely smudge if given the chance due to how smooth the mascara is. But it's waterproof! It comes off easily with some make up remover. For $9, this mascara is a must have!!! Wow!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I ordered this like a month ago when it went viral and it sold out. I knew it had to be good if a maybelline mascara was back ordered that long. Wowza. I was not disappointed. It has to be my favorite mascara ever. I have straight lashes aren't anything spectacular. They don't hold a curl so I have to train them up while applying mascara. This I can keep combing and positioning my lashes and it never got clumpy! It just keeps building. One coat looked like two! It's not clumpy. My lashes are giant and lifted. I honestly cannot believe it. I will update with a picture because it's kinda unbelievable. Some people say this is very difficult to wash off and it can be. I don't know why they don't market it as a tubing mascara because it most definitely is. An oil cleaner does a terrible job removing it. Lots of warm water and gentle rubbing breaks it up effortlessly. A regular cleanser will remove it as well but I really don't like to suds up my eyes. I take a makeup eraser or microfiber cloth with warm water and hold it on there for a few seconds to loosen it and and it crumbles off and wipes away pretty easily. I can confidently remove it in the shower with my fingers and sticking my face in the shower stream.
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I saw so many amazing reviews for this product on TikTok and knew I had to have it! Sadly when I used it I was not impressed. It does make your lashes appear longer... sort of. It clumps very easily and is very crumbly. The crumbly mascara gets in your eyes and it’s horribly painful. It happens way too often to look past. Especially at the end of the day trying to remove the mascara. It rips out lashes and crumbles in your eyes.

"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I have ONLY worn Maybelline mascara since I was a teen (that about 50 years now!). Maybelline ""Great Lash"" (washable), has always been my go-to mascara. I have tried over the years, other brands, including some other incarnations of Maybelline mascara, but always came to Great Lash. BUT...THIS time, after trying this new ""Sky High"", I don't think I'll be going back to Great Lash at all. Finally found a washable mascara that stays soft, doesn't get dry/flaky/brittle, looks more natural, and really does what it claims to do - make lashes look sky high. The only little flaw I found is it not as easy to take off as Great Lash and other mascaras I've used and tried over the years. I have always used Pond's Cold Cream to remove my mascara (whether it was the washable or the waterproof kind), and never had a problem. Sky High takes a little more ""elbow grease"" to remove, along with more tissues and cold cream."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I really love this mascara. I like the washable, black. It’s easy to remove. If I get a little on my eye- usually a dry qtip wipes it away. It doesn’t smear and make the speck “grow”. I find a couple of coats really gives me a nice length and desired coverage. My only downside is that I really go through this mascara. Like clockwork, I get about 5-6 weeks out and then it’s maxed out. I can tell when it’s low because it literally just stops coating and covering. With that being said- I wear mascara every single day. So I do get about 25-30 days of wear out of a tube. But I just feel like it should be lasting longer."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Super impressed with this mascara!!! One of the biggest problems I have is smudging due to my lash length on my top and bottom eyelids, and with this mascara I have not had ANY smudging….even after working out! I usually apply just one coat, which is pictured, and honestly it’s all I need to make my lashes super luscious. I’ve used just about every mascara you can think of and this by far is one of my faves and the price is also pretty nice! I don’t use makeup remover, just face wash and it does take a little more washing to get rid of, but it seriously lasts all day…. I love this!!"

The lashes were so clumped together. The worst part however was removal. I used makeup wipes, I used an oil makeup removing cleaner, I used dawn dish soap... NOTHING would take this off."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Ok, so I had heard and read all the reviews regarding this mascara. I was hesitant and mulled over whether to buy this for a month or so. I have tried many mascaras. My faves being Too Faced Better than Sex, Thrive, and many other named brands. With this mascara, I didn't want to curl my lashes or do anything to enhance my eyelashes. I wanted to see how this mascara worked with zero help. Needless to say, I was amazed. I did not curl my lashes before with my heater curler or do anything like I usually do. All I did was add 2 coats of this stuff and this is what it did. If I actually did my usual prep, I can only imagine what they'd look like or how long they'd be. My left eye is with 2 coats and my right eye has zero coats. As you can see my eyelashes go straight down with no mascara. So the fact this mascara was able to get my lashes to volume up with no corking, tells alot."

I was excited to try the black bottle and thought it was perfect because it wasn't as liquidy, but it is flakier and the bottle itself dried out before I finished it. I added eye drops (life hack: couple drops of regular eye drops and dry mascara is fixed) but I had to keep adding them to get through the bottle. I also found that the liquidy nature of the pink bottle makes it easier to build and looks more natural. I could have gotten a bad black bottle, but I'm sticking with the original one because it's truly such a good product!"

Light as air flexible beautiful lashes! 😘 This is my new (6 months) favorite in both washable and waterproof. You can't to wrong it does what it says and your lashes look and feel fabulous."

This Sky High has gotten a ridiculous amount of hype. I usually don't go by hype, but I really wanted to try this since it's from a line I love. The Lash Sensational full fan effect. Well the brush is different it's not curved it's thin and straight. It's not stiff but you still have control over it during application. It gets all the lashes beautifully. It really defined my lashes they looked very pretty. Although the hype is a bit much! I use the washable version. I had no flaking, no smudging and it held a curl all day. It washes off the same as the original Lash Sensational full fan effect if you've tried it you know what I mean. It comes off pretty easy I just always find I have to put a bit more work/time to remove it. It's no big deal. I love a mascara that separates my lashes and adds some length. Well this one is a bit better than the original Lash Sensational because it gives more length. Very good mascara!"

I have long, straight eyelashes and this is the only mascara that will hold them up and stay curled all day. I use shade ""blackest black"" (non-waterproof) and it stays all day with no smudging and holds shape wonderfully. I like to use it for my first coat and use a volumizing mascara on top (usually either maybelline lash sensational full fan effect or loreal lash paradise)"

After trying dozens! of brands from drug store to department store, in all price ranges, this is the one I always come back to. I have very thin lashes (I’m in my 50’s) that are a bit long, but very sparse. The brush picks up every single lash and the formula coats them evenly and completely. They look 3x thicker and twice as long. I never have to touch up or re-apply- it lasts until I take it off in the evening. I live in the south where the humidity is ridiculous, especially in the summer and I e never had an issue with smearing, smudging or wearing off. Give it a try…you may just be shocked (like me!) to find this gem."

It's reliable, if it's applied properly it does not clump, it does lengthen and add volume and unless you are swimming...the waterproof holds up even when you get a good cry in. You just soak your eyes with water, it comes off so easily. I'm talking soak, no rubbing. I do it in the shower. It comes off almost looking like lashes. I love that I don't have to rub my eyes with makeup remover anymore. I quit wearing waterproof because this really holds up and I'm an emotional train wreck that cries 65466 times a day lately. This stuff has not let me down once. My biggest gripe, I feel like I go through the tube too quickly but....I do wear it almost everyday now that I don't have to fight to remove it so it's probably just normal. If you need a little extra oomph, I use the loreal eyelash primer. Usually only when I want a more dramatic look though. Make sure you get that root girl..."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Okay I tried the non-waterproof version of this product and was pretty nonplussed. But then when I heard that your eyelashes stay curled all day long if you use a waterproof mascara, I bought this version and WHOA. My lashes hold a curl all day and look seriously insane. I get compliments all the time. Here are a few tips to make this product work really well: 1. Always curl your lashes FIRST. I like to heat my curler with a hair dryer for a few seconds (Never longer! You can easily burn yourself with the hot metal so be careful!) NEVER curl your eyelashes AFTER applying mascara or you risk pulling your lashes out. 2. Apply the first coat very thinly. I like to wipe down the wand before my applying first coat. The first coat is just to set the curl, not to build the lashes. Let it fully dry before adding your second coat which can be applied a bit thicker. Add as many layers as you like, but be advised that this formula can get pretty clumpy if you're not careful. 3. Dry your lashes by taking your hair dryer, and blow drying the lashes from the bottom to set the curl. Be sure to close your eye while you do this."

My lashes are long- but they don’t curl AT all and are 2 shades lighter than my eyebrows (weird, I know)  I bought this after it went viral on ig. It is now my goto holy grail don’t ever need another mascara again. Yes, it’s that good. Better than IT, too faced, fenty, tarte, cover girl, ABH, thrive, essence, il makiage, milk, bh, pretty much every mascara out there. The wand is just- everything. I used to prefer the cute hourglass from the better than sex mascara, the lash brag ABH wand, the other wands just don’t get every single lash the way this stuff does. I may still try others (makeup subs continue to send different brands) I just keep giving them to my daughter.  Bottom line- this mascara works well with long, straight lashes that are lighter than your brows, if that’s you then BUY this! The price tag is worth it alone! :-) Katie"

For the past couple of years I would wear falsies because I love what they did to my eyes, but for a mom on the run everyday I don’t have the time for that, so this mascara is the next best thing to falsies. Would definitely recommend!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","This mascara is magical. I have very few eyelashes, they’re very fine, and kind of light. I saw someone use this on Instagram and immediately bought it. I love this mascara so much I hope it never goes away. I get compliments daily on my lashes whereas that NEVER used to happen. I’ve found that the easiest way to take it off is by using some type of liquid make up remover (I use the oil free cetaphil one and it works wonders)."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I have tried SO MANY mascaras and am always game to try something new. I have short, thinning lashes due to age (53), so I started Latisse about a year ago, which works. But I digress. I have tried high-end mascaras and drugstore mascaras, and so many disappoint (I am looking at you Lash Paradise). This one ticks all of my boxes for a mascara: lengthening, volumizing, wet enough not to clump on application, small brush to grab lashes without any discomfort, and easy to remove. If you are on the fence about purchasing Sky High, give it a go. I will be using this mascara moving forward, unless I find a better formula/brush (unlikely)."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I chose this mascara strictly for the special brush shape and color. I use it for a setting brow gel and it's pretty darn great, at least a good substitute for the one I was having to buy from Amazon UK for big bucks. It grabs the hairs and thickens without clumping, you have to be a little careful though."

It doesn't add a lot of fullness, but it's 100% there for adding length to your lashes without the added little pieces of whatever that is you get with some other lengthening mascaras. It's not waterproof, but it sure acts like it! Even after swimming for an hour I still didn't look like a raccoon. It came off just as easily as regular mascara though, which I always remove with baby shampoo. Non pro tip for you there. ;-)"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I'm always on the look out for a good mascara and I saw the price of this and couldn't pass up the chance to give it a try. It's buildable without being too ""cakey"" and it DEFINITELY lengthens and separates my eyelashes without clumping or giving ""spider eyes"". The wand is great, its bendable, yet hard which gives me complete control of where I want to place the mascara. If I had to compare it to anything I'd say its super similar to the Benefits ""They're Real! Magnet"" mascara, minus the ""Theyre Real!"" price tag....It comes off when I wash my face with regular face wash, but I always use makeup remover as well to make sure all make up has been removed. Point is, it's never a struggle to get this mascara off. Lol  I've gotten SEVERAL compliments on my eyelashes, people asking if I have extensions hehe. I even had someone ask if I had my eyelashes dyed because I had only one coat on & apparently they couldn't tell I had mascara on hehe. So, I'll definitely be I putting this in my auto order to use on my daily makeup routine."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I was searching for a new mascara when this went on sale. My last one did not perform as expected. My daughter was trying to get me to go expensive. I am a minimalist in the make up department day-to-day. Eyeliner, mascara, moisturizer and maybe a touch of powder. This definitely gives length and thickness to my lashes. It does take a bit more effort to get off but I don’t use soap or make up remover, just a special face cloth and water. I highly recommend the Sky High Mascara."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Best mascara, hands down. For the last 10 or so years, I have been a colossal cat eye mascara girl. Of course I bought into the hype over this mascara on TikTok. I was super skeptical at first, because the brush is straight and not the same material or design that I was used to. I don’t need near as many coats, it doesn’t clump like other mascara, it comes off very easily with little water, and gives your lashes volume!  I never use waterproof mascara, so this may be the issue, but, it does seem to smudge more than I’m used to. Overall, best mascara I have found."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I have used the same mascara production for 6 or 7 years, so decided it was time to try something new. Revies led me to this waterproof, lash building mascara, and it is perfect for me! This mascara builds your largest as thick as you want them, adds length to them, and stay on until YOU remove it...which must be done with an oily product like Aquafor or baby oil. It IS difficult to remove, but that is what I wanted! My eyes cobstaeater, and this mascara stays put. Swimming? Stays put. Sweating during a workout? Stays put. Many friends have asked me where I had my extensions added and I love telling them about this mascara vice paying $250 plus for extensions. Try it!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Best mascara I’ve ever used. My eyes are very sensitive and this mascara doesn’t bother them at all. I can put it on at 6am and it won’t flake off into my eyes, which is normally very painful to me, or smudge at all even at 3 or 4 in the morning after a night out. I’ve even slept in the mascara which would normally cause intense pain from the flaking/smudging but I just wake up and the mascara still looks fresh. Not to mention the volume. The volume and thickness is amazing. I even lost a huge chunk of my natural lashes right in the center on the top of one of my lids due to a terrible lash glue when I first received the mascara and somehow this magical mascara found some tiny invisible lashes to grab onto and completely filled in that bald spot and made those lashes just as long as the rest of my lashes. I will continue to only buy this brand…unless they sadly change formula. You won’t be disappointed if you buy it."

I have tried so many different mascaras, mostly very disappointing, but this product is different. First, you can actually buy a true brown - not a black-brown. I love that, especially for everyday wear. Second, the amazing flexible brush! It seems to wrap around each eyelash separately and truly give great coverage without looking gloppy. And yes, it is washable. Comes off easily with soap and water but does not smear. I have finally found the perfect mascara!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I use the WASHABLE option. OMG! This mascara is what I’ve been looking for THE entire time… You can apply as much as you want and it does not start clumping **as long as you wait like 10 seconds between reapplications** The BEST part is that it works SO well that you DONT even need to use the lash curler before hand… My lashes are pretty straight and all I need to do is apply this mascara and they just elongate and curl up on their own… You MUST get this… You WON'T be disappointed!
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I think this is a great every day look! On some ppl, maybe those with more present eyes, or longer more voluminous lashes this will be a more dramatic look.  If that's not you, maybe invest in an eye lash curler if your lashes are less pronounced, or shorter, or more straight or down turned.  I like the look and feel this formula provides. The clean up is a cinch. If you're someone that has a hard time getting mascara off, this is not one of those difficult mascaras. I can't speak for the water proof formula. I bought the washable and was not disappointed.  The mascara lasts well through out the day! I hope this helps someone. I put on there coats but unlike some other formulas I start and focus on the ends rather than the roots. Works out better that way. The green of this formula is also very touchable. It's not hard or crusty. Feels very natural."

"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Maybelline will probably always be a dependable product line. They seem to keep abreast of the trends. This mascara has a comfortable, flexible wand with synthetic bristles. The formula is somewhat buildable. It does enhance length. Any mascara will help with length and thickness, compared to bare lashes. I may be over 65, but I'm still looking for more dramatic volume and density. Ultimately, I used this as a base to get initial coverage before applying a mascara that provided more thickness. But it's good to be aware of what's available when you're not expecting high-end results or are just wanting a lighter, more natural look."

So I suggest that after application that one should take clean mascara brush & run it through one’s lashes to remove clumps. If they fix the clumping issues this product would be amazing. It’s convenient to buy it here on Amazon but if you’re looking for a cheaper price your best bet is a Walgreens or a Rite Aid because they always have coupons on hand on these types of products. Oh one more thing YES! I Recommend this product.

I’ve been hunting for the perfect mascara for years (Essence gave me raccoon eyes, Vivienne Sabot’s brush felt sharp or something I dunno) and the original Lash Sensational was as close as I’d gotten. This is better. Bulletproof even though it’s not technically waterproof, unbelievable definition, buildable to decent volume, and the only “curling” mascara that’s ever done a damn thing for me. It looks like you either have naturally shocking lashes, or the world’s best set of falsies. 10/10. Will buy forever."

It isn't clumpy or messy but makes my lashes look fuller and not fake which I did not like in other mascaras I've tried.  All of that AND a price that cannot be beat!

My skin is oily so it's important to me that a black mascara doesn't smudge under my eyes, and Sky High doesn't. I don't wear a lot of makeup but I like long lashes. Sky High applies easily and quickly, doesn't smudge and comes off with water. I even rubbed my eyes accidentally and my lashes stayed separated with no glopping together. What could be better?

I do, but only if I am going for a more photogenic lash for a photoshoot. Otherwise, this stuff works wonders and makes my lashes look longer than they actually are!  NOTE: I did have to put on several coats (I did three in total) to really get this to look good. I would put on two, at the very least. Also, take your time putting it on (if you are a newbie) otherwise, you will get clumping!"

It got to the point I finally gave up trying. Then I read the reviews on this and decided, why not?! I didn't have anything to lose. SO HAPPY I DID!!!! I will never try anything else again!!!

I don't get that raccoon look after a few minutes or hours under my eyes. It also stays on until I take it off! I have finally found "" The One""...until they discontinue it...lol.

I swear this stuff is the best mascara I’ve tried and I’ve tried A LOT. Price points Anywhere from $5 - $40. Until I tried this I was a die hard Thrive Causemetics mascara user but I was tired of spending $30 on it and having to wait to get it. The ONLY thing I like better about Thrive is it is much easier to remove because it’s a tubing mascara. Even my partner said something about how I looked. Said that he noticed my eyelashes. He doesn’t pay attention to that kind of stuff... I highly recommend this product. It’s my new favorite. Plus the packaging is nice. It’s pretty.

I like a more clumpy look because I can get away with not wearing fake lashes. I have short length and semi-straight eyelashes. This mascara managed to lengthen my lashes to where I could see it even with my chunky eyeliner on. It's definitely more length than volume, and curled/held up my lashes a bit. (I didn't curl them in the photos) I want to say no other mascara has provided such length and curl for me recently, so I'm really impressed! Overall I would recommend this mascara to anyone looking for serious length. If you have very straight/drooping lashes, you might want to use a curler and get the waterproof version."

Signed up for autoship so I won't run out. I've received several compliments and asked if they're my real Lashes or fake. Even my dentist commented that he could see my eyelashes from the hallway lol. I will only give credit when it's due and I'd give this mascara 10 stars if I could."

It reminds me a lot of an old favorite, the long discontinued Maybelline Sky High Curves but this one is better. Lots of length and curl and volume too. For reference I have decent lashes- pretty long, not stick straight, but they are kind of sparse and grow in different directions. This mascara makes them look more uniform and doesn’t seem to clump, even after a few coats. Did not run or flake either- a really nice, inexpensive mascara."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","The mascara is super clumpy. Not sure if I just got a bad tube, but it’s terrible. It looked nothing like it promised. It left my lashes super hard and then I couldn’t get it off! I had to use my face wash, makeup wipe, eye makeup remover, and then finally pick the rest of the clumps off with my nails!! My poor lashes took a beating! I definitely would not use this again!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I absolutely love the volume that I get from this mascara! Although it is hard to get off on occasion and I find myself struggling to use the product the next day because I still have some stuck to my eyelashes even after scrubbing everything. Overall I am very pleased with this product and this has been the second time I’ve bought this mascara.
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I have tried literally hundreds of mascaras and this one has edged them all out. It builds volume and length like crazy and it doesn't budge even with my oily eyelids and teary eyes. Taking it off requires a little extra cleansing but it's totally worth it!

"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","This mascara has been hyped on every social media platform but impossible to find in all the usual drug stores and big box stores.Guess who had a a dollar less ?..AMAZON The first time I wore it(super easy application) the young checker at my grocery store whispered..are you wearing lash extensions, Nope just this amazing product ,which I then brought up on my phone...she said as soon as her break ..she was ordering I got to say Maybelline is knocking it out of the ball oark .When you are 68 and a young woman gives you such a comment,it makes you feel like a million bucks"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Wow. I normally use the telescopic, but I wanted to try something else. This is great! Makes my lashes look really long. Easy to use. Shipping took a while, but it was worth the wait."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I put on mascara almost every day. This is my favorite mascara so far for specific reasons 1 It's lightweight, not clumpy mascara that gives a natural look. 2 easily washable, (not waterproof) so I don't have a hard time removing it, even with just soap and water. This may be a downside if you rub your eye because it will smudge worse than waterproof mascara. 3 very volumizing and lengthening 4 very smooth and easy to use"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Best drugstore mascara I've ever used. I usually buy Thrive cosmetics mascara but it's pretty expensive, so I figured I'd give this a try. The wands are very similar and the Maybelline sky high gave me great length and separation just like the Thrive mascara does. The Maybelline does have a more flexible wand which threw me off at first but was helpful for getting the corners of my eyes. The formula is a nice and shiny black color, and the consistency is just right. I don't think it gave me as much volume as the thrive mascara, but for a 20+ dollar difference, I can accept that."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Love love love this macará. If I’m honest I did buy it for the hype, but only after watching reviews on YouTube. I definitely do not regret this purchase. It does add a little volume, but the length is just incredible. I use it for work daily and even when sweating it doesn’t smear. My favorite part is that when I shower I can just let my face soak and the mascara comes of with just wiping my lashes with my fingers. It doesn’t make my lash come off at all, just the mascara. I will definitely keep buying and I recommend it 100%"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Maybe, maybe not. Depends what you’re looking for I suppose. As someone who has been a professional MUA for 15+ years, it’s prob not something I’d keep in my kit... but for me, to wear daily for work? It’s great. Separates and lengthens, but does sometimes get clumpy and give spider-lash if you’re not careful with application. I do not have the waterproof version, because I don’t need it for personal use, but even at that, it doesn’t smudge or smear with the slightly teary eyes you get from a sneeze or just regular, daily life. I prob wouldn’t wear it to swim or to a funeral though."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Pros: I love the applicator, its flexible, thin and has small silicon material bristles that separate eyelashes easily. I like the thin mascara, it goes on smoothly and you don't need very much. It made my eyelashes appear longer, but not thicker.  Cons: if you don't remove it at night it is very flakey the next day, little pieces kept getting into my eyes. As long as you wash it at night, it's fine. I did find that my normal face wash cloths didn't remove it very well, I had to put micellar water on it to get it all off."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I have been using l'oreal double extend mascara for over 20 years. I thought it was the best mascara out there until now! I highly, highly recommend Maybelline Shy High mascara. My lashes look natural and super long. The pictures don't do it justice. You will not be disappointed with this mascara. On my first day wearing the mascara I had 4 different people come up to me to tell me how beautiful my eyes were and asked me what kind of mascara I use."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",Love this mascara! I’ve used Lancombe my whole life until I took a chance one day & finally bought my first ever “drug store purchase” & I have been hooked ever since! I have longer eyelashes already but this mascara is just amazing!
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I cannot say enough about this mascara- I’m still shocked at how well it works. I’ve never been a huge makeup person, but as I’m well into my 30’s now, I’ve actually been getting into it. Mostly I’ve found that you do get what you pay for and have spent a small fortune on all the “good stuff” but *THIS* inexpensive, easily accessible option is perfection! It goes on quickly and easily, doesn’t clump, doesn’t smudge or smear, and it doesn’t require multiple layers. I love it!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I had been debating for months about buying a more expensive Beauty brand mascara, but couldn't justify the cost when I don't wear it often. But then I saw this on a Tiktok trends list, saw it locally, and decided to try it.  I was in love from the get-go, and the price is perfect as a subscribe and save. So prefect, I actually started wearing on a more frequent basis! It lasts all day, doesn't rub off easily (I get waterproof) and gives me great length."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I always purchase waterproof because I cry at the drop of a hat. Like, sad song with shivering puppies during the ASPCA commercials? SOBBING! That being said, when I saw on Yahoo that this mascara was like, SUPER DUPER awesome, I ran right over to my keyboard and pounded out my order on Amazon. It was on back-order but I rec'd it a week sooner than it said to expect it. It made my teensy-weensy stubby lashes look like falsies (aint nobody got time for that) AND came off quite easily with my choice of no-rub eye-makeup remover: coconut oil."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Maybelline has done it again!!! They know how to make an amazing mascara (with the exception of their ""Great Lash"" my mom used when I was growing up- that crap sucks lol) Sky High gives exceptional length and was very easy to work with. I included a couple pics but I forgot to take pics after I did my bottom lashes so I will try and update with pics of the finished look. But I was super impressed with how long my lashes looked and no clumping which is impressive bc I tend to pile on several coats throughout the day. Love it."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I have never had a waterproof mascara that did not run. This stays put up to 10 hours before I wash it off. I work in hot conditions sometimes. This stuff is great! I never look like a raccoon with it at the end of my shift. I love it!
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",My new favorite mascara! I have purchased at least 10 mascaras this year and I have now purchased 3 of these because I am obsessed! People keep asking g who dies my lashes because they think I’m wearing fake lashes! But they are mine and it’s because this mascara makes them look so long and it separates them! Buy it!!! You will thank me after! Take it from a mascara snob who buys all price ranges!
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","This stuff is the bomb and best mascara I’ve found for my somewhat sparse lashes. The length it creates is amazing! My lashes look long and full, it lasts all day and stays put until I remove it. Easy to take off and doesn’t flake or smudge. The brush is flexible which took a little getting used to but it gets into the inner corners and covers every lash. I love everything about it!!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","This mascara is great - holds my lashes up, they don't go flat, and the mascara does not clump. I'm not sure if I received a crappy tube though, because its practically empty. Like nothing comes out on the wand - or maybe that's how it is. I wear this all day at work, then go to the gym, and it's still perfect. I do have to apply alot more makeup remover to get it off though. Overall, I definitely do like it. I also use the Thrive Cosmetics mascara, which is great. So if you're looking for a mascara that matches the Thrive, this is the one."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Longest wearing mascara I have ever used. After a long 10 1/2 shift not one flake. It looks the same 15 hours after putting it on. It is not waterproof, but it does not immediately come off or run when wet. It comes off in the shower, but only with rubbing. If you aren’t in the shower you need to use a lot of water or makeup remover. It comes off like little tubes. Great length, doesn’t add as much volume as my favorite mascara. Over all this is the best for long days at work or traveling."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",THIS cosmic black mascara is way darker and more noticeable'then the regular sky high formula I am hooked
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I love this mascara! It has so much volume and it just makes my eyelashes pop! Hopefully you've watched the video so you can see how much difference in makes from no makeup to putting the Maybelline lash sensation sky high on my lashes. It's a good deal it doesn't flake off or run and I just can't believe what a good deal it is. It's not expensive at all! So I highly recommend it and please watch my videos so you can see the difference between no makeup and the mascara.
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",This mascara is AMAZING!! I usually use the Thrive liquid extension mascara. I am tired of paying a ton for mascara. This mascara is not a total dupe but darn close! My lashes are ridiculously long when I use this mascara. Without looking spider-y. No clumping. The wand is quite flexible and tapered making it easy to get into the nooks and crannies on the corners of the eye. I have not used it on the bottom lashes. I use jojoba oil and a cloth to take it off... easy removal. ABSOLUTELY will buy again!!!
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I like this mascara b/c it glides on well, plumps up your lashes. After the first coat dries a little, you can put a second coat to lengthen lashes more. I usually just do one coat for a more natural look. I haven't tried the waterproof yet. Mascara doesn't flake and smear, however if you are a crier it is not pretty. It will definitely run."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I was sucked into buying this because of TikTok like a lot of other people. I couldn’t find it anywhere so out of desperation I purchased the waterproof and HATED it. I decided to give the regular formula a try and am so glad I did! I already have long lashes and this actually made them longer! Most importantly it did not make my lashes clumpy. This is so important to me, I don’t have time to separate them in the mornings. It held up well too not smudging at all. Love this mascara!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","This mascara has to be the absolute best mascara I have ever used! The length it adds to your lashes is something out of this world!! To show comparison, in the collage photo the photos on the right are with this mascara next to ones on left that are not! The other photo is of course with it. Need I say more!!! If you're on the fence with this try it! You won't be disappointed! I will definitely be purchasing again!!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",I have tried so many different mascaras. You name it I've tried! This mascara is the best! ☆Price - can anyone beat this price?!?! ☆smudge free - Asian with single eye-lid.. you know the deal... ☆easy to clean only need face foam cleanser ☆length - I was asked if I had false eyelashes. ☆volume perfect ☆ it separates lashes but doesn't look like your lashes are missing in pieces. Just try it!! You won't regret it!!

I loved this mascara and have usually used high end, expensive mascaras in the past. They all work for an hour max and then my eyelash are back down and not visible. This mascara was fantastic and kept my lashes up all day long. It’s the best mascara I have ever used in my life. the waterproof is a little hard to take off but not impossible. Included is a picture with the sky high mascara and the better than sex (not as good). Highly recommend this mascara."
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",This product does not give you sky high lashes—but that is okay. Yoj wouldn’t be able to walk through doors if it did. What it dies give you is a fabulous long lash on top and bottom. I don’t think I’ll ever buy another mascara. This one stays out until you remove it. Other lash-lengthening mascaras have worked but also left remnants of the fibers all over my face all day. This one is clean! No flaking. No shedding. Perfect!!! Six out of five stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","I’m very picky about mascara. I rarely try anything new but I saw one of my favorite YouTubers use this and knew I needed to try it! It’s amazing! It doesn’t get clumpy, the applicator is easy to use and on the thinner side which I prefer, and makes my eyelashes look very long without having to use a eyelash curler. It’s a little hard to remove but so worth it!"
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司",Holy cow! I was expecting a good mascara but I was not expecting to be completely blown away by how amazing this mascara is! It made my thin sad eyelashes so gorgeous! It curled them and made them look like extensions. I love that the applicator is plastic and very bendable. It makes it easy to apply on all of the lashes. I will be buying ONLY this mascara for as long as they make it. I was definitely not disappointed.
"Maybelline New York Sky High 可洗睫毛膏,丰盈睫毛膏,可搭建,加长睫毛膏,定型,卷曲,多重,非常黑色,0.24 液体盎司","Folks, this IS the needle in the haystack! Finally a mascara that doesn’t come off until I take it off! If you’re old enough to remember Cover Girl Marathon mascara (looks just put on until you take it off 🎶), then you’ll understand. I have tried literally hundreds of different mascaras over the past 15 years trying to find one that doesn’t flake, smudge or smear and this one allowed me to throw away all of the others I’ve collected. FIVE STARS and I can even buy it at Wal-Mart 😍😍😍"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",Best eyeliner ever. I don’t know why or how but this shade “bronze” is literally the only eyeliner I can wear all around my eye and feel like it’s flattering. I’ve been using it for about 3 years now. I definitely recommend this liner in Bronze.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","As I've gotten older (I'm 35 now), I've noticed that the skin on my eyelids is a bit looser than it used to be and the eye pencils I used to use pull more and don't go on as smoothly as they used to. The NYX mechanical eye pencils (but not their regular eye pencils) goes on as smooth as silk! I like that it goes on thick/wide, but if you want something precise, this isn't it. It doesn't smudge easily and truly stays on all day. I did have one pencil that only twisted out about 1/8 inch before the mechanism got stuck (I had to throw it out), but with the low cost and high performance, it didn't bother me much. I'm used to using MAC and Clinique pencils ($18+), so if I have an occasional dud with this brand, it's still totally worth it!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",i can smudge it the way i need it to get that smokey eyes effect Super easy to put on waterline Its my third pencil and nothing can compare to how easy and quick it allows to do makeup
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",I bought this eye liner for my Halloween costume and the white dots last all day. The pencil was easy to use and i even used it on my waterline because i have small eyes and that stayed on all day as well. This eye liner is a good quality and does not irritate the eyes.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",Wow! Love love love!. Ive been looking for a good water line pencil and GIIIIIIIRRRRRLLL This is the best Water Proof pencil for the water lines.Thank You
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",Use this on my water line and so many other hi end blk pencils transfer onto my bottom lid and skin. Raccoon city! This stays put! I buy three at a clip!
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I'm HORRIBLE at applying eyeliner, so this was a godsend. It's creamy, so it doesn't snag on your eyelid when you apply it, but it dries out in a minute or so, so it actually lasts all day. If I want a darker look, I put on black or navy eyeliner and then apply this on top -- it smooths over the shakiness of the dark eyeliner, and looks a whole lot more interesting (like I actually put work into it, when I really didn't). I also wear it by itself sometimes, because it's light and looks a bit like metallic eyeshadow if you smudge it -- but still appropriate for wearing to class or going to work. I used to use Glossier's Lidstar (liquid eye shadow), but I found this and it works so much better -- it stays on for a lot longer, doesn't fade, and actually reaches the lid line. Even though it stays on for a while (all day -- 10 hours +), it comes off really easily with a wipe or miscellar water.  It's great for covering mistakes or simply as a stand-in so you don't have to project to the world that you have no clue what you're doing with eyeliner. I plan to buy the gold/blue too.  (Note: you can find this product for a lot cheaper at any other store -- Bed, Bath + Beyond/Target/CVS/Ulta.)"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I have bought multiple white eye liners in the recent past trying to find one that stayed on my lower water line. I got this one in the other day and went ahead and tried it on while I was working in the house, just to see if it would hopefully perform better than any of the others that were total wastes of money.  This applies super easily, very creamy, with bright light visible color on the water line and it STAYED. I did wipe it out of the corners near the tear ducts , due to working and sweating here in the house, but along the rest of the water line, it stayed where I put it for the entire afternoon and evening. It did fade slightly later but it has far out performed all the others I tried.  A single application of this when doing ' proper ' makeup, would probably last through an entire evening function or most of a work day, depending on your work environment.  It gives the eyes a very nice pop but I do highly recommend either putting this on before mascara or putting an extra coat of mascara on after applying it to the water line. It is very creamy and will stick to the base of the lashes along the water line and needs to be covered over to avoid any whit and black lash affect.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it and am absolutely thrilled to have finally found one after five attempts with other brands , that not only shows up really well, but stays put !  I am about to order two more, which is what reminded me to sit and write a review just now.  Mrs. Yvonne Hancock"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色", I wish that I'd found this sooner. LOVED IT. Didn't smudge when using with hooded eyes.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色", I really liked this liner. It has a very subtle shimmer and it’s perfect for a natural look. Im not one to go for natural looks often but I think it’s great for the fall. I don’t mind if it’s smudge proof since I like under eye eyeliner a tad bit smudged. It great works for me.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I bought 3 shades of this eyeliner, gold bronze & g*psy blue Bronze - Darker than expected. The images & packaging make it look like this should be more shimmery. It's basically just a dark brown liner with a hint of shimmer. Probably won't buy this color again. Gold - Doesn't last as long as the others, fades faster. It's a light gold shade, but seems to be semitransparent as it blends into my skin very easily and is not highly visible. If you load it on it makes a nice shade with more impact. G*psy Blue - NYX, do you realize that G*psy is a racial slur? Maybe reconsider the name. The color itself is a deep blue-green, the packaging looks more green, but it shows up more blue on skin. Very pretty color."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This is my go to eyeliner. Its excellent. Mechanical so you never have to sharpen it. So easy to apply and goes on sooo smooth. Sometimes you have to paint a few strokes on your hand first to get it to soften and paint strong. Doesn't smudge - lasts all day. I use the black on the waterline every day - and sometimes the white as eyeliner,"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","*Note*: I apply eyeliner to my waterlines, not my eyelids. It looks fine and doesn't cause any mucus build-up around my eye. It does need to be reapplied occasionally (as it is on the waterline) and does and takes a few passes when applying to really get the color to show. The semi-hard, semi-soft pencil isn't the most comfortable to apply to a waterline, and the slight hardness means it can be hard to really get the pencil to start applying."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Play Video  I didn’t use the eyeliner for the wing part of this look, but I smudged it all over my lid to put as a base for the eyeliner and it worked amazing! I also have this in my waterline and smudged on my upper lid between the lashes. It wears nicely, and I definitely enjoy it."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I got this liner in the bronze color. For reference, I am a light-skinned blonde with green eyes. I am sixty years old as well. I am always looking for an eyeliner that won't look too heavy or hard. This bronze color is perfect and goes on very smoothly with no tugging at all. Absolutely love it and definitely would purchase it again."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner! I'm 43yo & don't want a liner that I have to pull my eyelids tight to put on or really tug to smudge, & with this, I don't! It's super soft, so it glides on with ease- no pulling or tugging! Albeit it's soft, it's not TOO soft; it's just right! Totally recommend, especially for mature/maturing skin."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",this white eye liner is perfect! it stays on for a long time and it’s super bold! i totally suggest this eye liner for your water line and inner corners! it’s so cute and perfect <3!
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I used to use Rimmel eyeliner in ""pine"". It must have been discontinued because I haven't found it in years. This is pretty close. This pencil was a bit disfigured but I shaped it back. I think it melted in shipment from the Arizona heat. It has a very slight shimmer, but more matte than sparkly. Seems to be pretty smudge proof and waterproof. Happy with my purchase and going to buy more colors. This Golden Olive pairs beautifully with Kiko #209 eyeshadow that I just got."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",Works as it should and is very creamy! Haven’t had issues with the waterproof abilities or any smudging. I like putting it on my waterline to brighten up my eyes :)
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","You never know with these and being a 'mechanical' pencil, I was skeptical but the description was true.......it is a soft crayon type pencil, very slender with a twist bottom to extend or retract. Came 3 in a package and for the price, it's a bargain. Today is the first time I am using the pencil. I applied it several hours ago and it's holding strong so for now, I gave it a 'only need to apply once during the day'. I tend to have a lot of pink coloring in my water line which I'm not a fan of but this pencil does a nice job of covering it up and making the whites of my eyes pop."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","First I would like to say that the price is very good. I bought this eyeliner because I was running out of my current eyeliner and needed one ASAP and I wanted to try a pencil eyeliner (since I mostly use liquid ones). Upon arrival everything was excellent, the pigment is very black and nice, but I’ve been using it for a month now and I have a few things to say. It applies nicely, gives me the ability to line very close to my lashes giving them a fuller look, which is what I love about pencil eyeliners vs liquid. It was pretty waterproof, had to use makeup remover to get rid of it since water wasn’t cutting it. However, the true down fall is that it smudges. If you let it it dry a little it’s a bit more smudge proof (at least when tester on my hand which is the thick lightly smudged test in the picture) but I have noticed that it gets under my eyes. giving them a dark look after a while maybe after 8 hours (funny thing is I don’t apply it to my lower lash line!). If I am careful to avoid smudging, it lasts all day. I will say decent liner if you’re on a money crunch, it’s definitely usable, but the smudging really got to me. I’m constantly checking under my eyes for any smudging/transfer. As a daily eyeliner user, it’s not very convenient. Overall 3.5, not the worst eyeliner, it applies really well, easy to use, but not the best. I’m still on the hunt for the “perfect eyeliner”!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I used to use the Sephora brand equivalent of this pencil in brown. A good dark brown is hard to find so far only NYX, Sephora, & Urban Decay (non mechanical) have a brown that’s dark enough but this one is great. Stays all day. Good I’m waterline and above lashes. My new everyday liner."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This is one of my favorite liners! It is inexpensive and comes in so many cool colors - my favorite is the gypsy blue. I also love the smudger brush on this liner to get that smokey effect. I do have thin eyelashes, and another one of my favorite liners that actually contains a lash growth serum to grow my lashes is  B078JHF1Q6 Lavish Liner by Hairgenics Pronexa – 2-in-1 Precision Liquid Eyeliner Pen . It is worth the money and will help grow your lashes and the liner itself is a precise liquid pen which works great. I hope this review helps everyone out there!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I'm an avid gym goer who isn't one of those cute non sweat-ers. Nope, I lift and run a total of 2 hours and start sweating after just 5 minutes so when I read the no run/no smudge/stay put reviews on this eyeliner, I had to try it. Wow! After the gym this morning I literally had a million things to do and errands to run for the following 7 hours, including a shower and 9 hours later and it still hasn't budged! I have very oily skin and even dry liners smudge and give me raccoon eyes. Not this stuff. I ordered another 3 pencils and coming back for more. What a find!!!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","First of all, I'm in my 50s and have worn inner lower lid liner since I was 16-years-old.  For years, I have searched for a long lasting, smudge proof, comfortable, beautiful inner lower lid, eyeliner. THIS IS IT!  I have had it on for 16 hours and 38 minutes.  During this time, I have stared at my work computer 8 hours, my allergies acted up so my eyes watered (I knew I would have to reapply but miraculously, it appeared as though I had just applied it), worked out for about 2 hours, showered, but most notable, I took a nap for about an hour, got up, used the restroom, and when washing my hands, I looked in the mirror and voila--this eyeliner looked the same as when I had applied it.  Next, I'm going to see if this company makes a long lasting eyebrow pencil.  I sell Avon on the side but I'm going to be talking about this on my blog and my social media. This is worth its weight in gold as its staying power has totally exceeded my expectations. I'll be ordering more as I don't ever want to be without it."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","First, let me confess that I am ""Eyeliner challenged"". Not only that, but I really, really need to wear it. My hair is blond going gray. I have short eyelashes and prominent eyelids. Without liner and mascara, my eyes literally disappear or look tired and droopy. I've tried every kind of eyeliner imaginable. Finding a light shade that isn't too harsh for my fair coloring is another issue. I bought this is 'bronze' and it's a winner for me. This is so easy to use I may just start wearing it daily! I only just tried it this morning so I can't say how well it lasts. And I can't talk about its resistance to water. I put it on over a crayon shadow and it went on smoothly without a lot of tugging. It makes a fairly thick line but the light color is just right for the soft look I've wanted. No ""cat eyes"" here."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",This pencil is really good. First time trying it and love it 😍 it even lasted all day especially the heat in Florida🌴☀️
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This pencil has great pigment, and is soft enough to deposit a generous amount of color but is not so soft that it breaks when carried around in my makeup bag, bumping into other liners and lipsticks and all that. it does mix with my eyeshadow when i’m not careful, leaving a slight tint of whatever color i was using, but if i’m careful (and not very caffeinated and shaky) it’s not an issue. i’ve used other liners from this brand as well and they’re great quality, impressive for the price."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I’m a 58 year old woman and I’ve tried about 50 brown eye liner pencils. I’ve spent up to $40, in hopes that I’d find one that’s right for me. I use my eyeliner up, under my top lashes. After chemo, 11 years ago, my lashes barely grew back. Yep, for anyone who doesn’t know, you lose ALL of your hair. Lashes, brows, nose hair, all of it. Anyway, my lashes are now super short, sparse and I haven’t any in the outer corners. I push this liner up into my lash line and under my lower lashes. I do this every day and even though I wash my face in the evening, I leave my eyeliner on. I don’t want to look at the bald spots. This is the first eyeliner that has actually stayed. It even stays in the areas where I don’t have any eyelashes. In the morning, it will be smudged a bit, but that’s easily cleaned up with a Q-tip and a bit of water. I would’ve never thought that this an expensive eyeliner would be my favorite of all time. I’m so glad that I found it."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I LOVE this eyeliner; I probably wear it 4-5 days a week. Honestly, I bought it a few months back just because it looked cheap and I didn't want anything expensive since I'm still just learning my way around makeup, but it's turned out to be genuinely good!!  It's a retractable crayon, so you don't have to sharpen it or anything, and it glides on really smoothly. I usually like to kinda smudge it when I'm putting it on, but once it's on it probably lasts like 8-12 hrs before it starts smudging/fading off. It's also nice because it's really easy to darken your waterline with it; I don't feel like I'm gonna poke my eye out when I do it, and it glides off super easily (I can't do that with most other liners I've tried).  The one thing I will say about it is since it's a crayon you can't sharpen, it's really difficult to do a *precise* wing. If you're looking to do a sharp wing, I'd probably go with a liquid felt-tip liner instead.  Overall though, I really like this liner. It's super easy to use, lasts a pretty long time (also safe to wear when chopping onions), and only smudges when you actually *try* to smudge it."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Let’s be done with this right up front: this eye pencil is smudge-proof, water resistant (allergy eyes and laughing tested), and lasts all day. There. Now… I have tried many many many white eye pencils and liquid liners. Most wore of quickly or didn’t give me a great pop the white that I was looking for. FINALLY, this one paid off. The white is bright and works in the corner of my eyes, the accent on the top of my eyelids, and in my waterline. It goes on velvety smooth allowing me to sharpen the point up and obtain a fine line or lay it down on its side for a bolder contrast point. Love it. Absolutely. Threw out the others."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Over the years, I've tried just about every eye pencil in every color that is out there, but always come back to NYX's Mechanical Eye Pencil. They also make non-mechanical eye pencils as well, the ones you have to hand sharpen, but I prefer this type - just turn the base as much or as little as you want, to expose more of the pencil. I have found this pencil glides on a lot smoother and easier, particularity on the eye's sensitive water line. Additionally, as someone with with lots of skin and contact allergies, I have no reaction to this pencil or the entire color line, at all."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I have split hair and ive been looking high & low for eyebrow solutions. I got this and it solved my problem. It feels a little waxy, if you dont set it - so ive just been setting it with purple eyeshadow.  THANKS NYX!!!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Per reviews -I was looking for a creamy fine point twist up Brown. Very satisfied, this is my second one for the price can't beat it. No tugging, long wearing, and it has to be the ""color"" brown for me. Not too dark, but you can add some black eyeshadow/ dark brown over it. It makes my hazel eyes pop, no irritation and stays put!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This is my favorite eyeliner within my stingy budget. I've used black, brown, and bronze. I use bronze most often, and I may be imagining things, but I do feel like that color is a little softer than the other two. I personally like that; it goes on smooth and strong. If you wind out a lot of the pencil, it'll probably break pretty easily, but since there's no reason to unwind a lot of it... just don't do that.  It's pretty waterproof. I love waterproof, because it withstands a lot of adventures. I've been swimming with it with no problem, and it's withstood an unfortunate amount of tears at times. Even after I get out of the shower, where I've washed my face, it takes some extra work to get it all off. If I really layer it on, like on days I'm having a stupid time applying it nicely and have to go over it a few times, it can sometimes leave subtle ""prints"" above my eyelids (where it touches my skin when my eyes are open) after a few hours of wear, but normally that isn't a problem.  I like that I can make a clean line (though not as crisp as liquid, obviously), or I could smudge it up a bit to make it more natural.  I did have a black one that was pretty hard and didn't turn out very dark without layering, but I think it was just a bad batch or something, since the black one I have now is softer and seems normal."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I have routinely, out of desperation, spent $45 plus on eyeliner claiming to be water resistant go on smoothly and have staying power. Got four shades of this great priced eyeliner. It stays put all day and into the night. That’s with no eye primer I just slapped it on. Doesn’t pull the eye delicate skin. I am a makeup junky. Having said that I’m ordering one for my purse one for my car one for my go to bag one for my makeup counter one for my office one for my extra makeup bag…….oh yeah should pick one up whatever."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",I have tried every eyeliner made and I am always disappointed. I have poor eyesight and have to use a magnified mirror to apply properly. This product was moist enough to glide on smoothly and evenly. No touch ups necessary. I did have a couple of flakes under my eyes but I think it was due to contact with my bottom lashes. Clean up was easy and didn't smudge. Lasted through date night and still looked great. I also LOVE the bronze color.. Very flattering for my warm blonde complexion. Will definitely purchase again!
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I'll be turning 60 next year (how did that happen?!) and starting to rethink my eyeliner. I've been using black/ebony since I was old enough to wear makeup. Realized it's time for a change, especially when a smokey eye is not called for, something for every day to bring out my eyes, but not go crazy. This bronze shade is exactly what I need--subtle, yet with the gold tones, it nicely highlights the eyes. I highly recommend it."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I own this in black and decided to try the green in order to make my eyes pop. I love it. It goes on easy (especially compared to the liquid eyeliner I was using before). I don't worry about this drying out or anything like with liquid liner and I'm not worried about spills or melting. I throw this on at 6 AM before work and it stays on throughout the workday until I get home and wipe it off at ~ 6 PM. I've gotten compliments on the eyeliner making my eyes pop, and I would certainly buy again. My only complain is that after the initial use, the tip of the pen becomes rounded, so if you want a delicate, thin line, this isn't for you. I wish you could sharpen the tip in order to get some thinner lines, but it's not world ending."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",I used it for a showgirls inspired makeup look and I was shocked by how pigmented the white came out to be!! I tested it on my hand first before my eye and forgot it was there so I went to wipe it off and it didn’t budge!! I loved that. Some creamy liner can be so messy but this one wasn’t at all. Stayed on all day and didn’t move.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",This goes on easily enough but the pencil breaks and you lose much of it. I've had it break on me a couple times and each time I lose about1/4 inch. I'm not sure how to make it stronger and still glide on. It is easy to soften the look by smudging the product before it sets. The gray is nice for me with gray hair and gives a soft look.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I've bought gray eyeliner in all the big drugstore brands except this one and I think Rimmel. I got this one based on amazon reviews and wow it does not disappoint! It's a good gray. It's goes on more smoothly and softly than the others I've gotten before. I wore it all day at home, and it didn't smudge or rub off from my eyelid or waterline (though no touching, no sweating or tearing up). It came off eyelid pretty well with regular face washing, though it stuck around on the lower lashline (probably due to closing of eyes while washing). New favorite drugstore eyeliner!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I am quite impressed with this eye liner! I got the brown, and it is a dark brown, and I like the color :) it went on very easily. By the end of my 10-hour day it’s a bit smudged, so I wish they made a water-resistant version. But I still liked it so much that I ordered 3 more, looking forward to trying the black and purple! Can’t beat the quality for the price! If you’re looking for a very thin eye liner I would not get this- I like pretty bold thick-ish lines so it is perfect for me. Other reviewers mentioned that it broke- but I had no issues with this. The trick might be to only have a very small part of the liner out of the pencil holder at a time."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Ok make-up fans, we ALL know the dilemma between breaking our wallets for a good eyeliner that actually applies on your eyes rather than scratches them without barely any pigment at all. How have I just now discovered this jewel?! An affordable eyeliner that actually GLIDES!!! I can even do my waterline with this baby! I seriously don't think I'll ever buy another brand again. My confusion may have been with NYC (who SUCKS, do NOT buy NYC eyeliner) but this is NYX, completely different brand and my officially new fav. Also tried their lipliner which is awesome as well."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This is a good, very white, eyeliner pencil. I use if on my lower waterline and it is the best I've found. It is nice and creamy so it is easy to apply without tugging and so white that I prefer it after it settles in a bit and loses some of the starkness. So much better than some of the ones I've tried that look gray or slightly dirty on the eye."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",Lasts all day long!
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",The Best Inexpensive Waterproof Eyeliner on the Market 🌷  Waterproof 🌷: You can wear it all day as an eyeliner and it will not run.  Great Color 🌷: Great Dark Color that will not fade and lasts all day.  Easy Application🌷: It glades on the face easily yet it is not too oily.  Long Lasting🌷 : It doesn't get oily after hours of being on your face.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","NYX smudge proof brown eyeliner is great for every day natural look makeup. After applying to your lash line, you can refine the look by going over the area with a soft liner brush. NYX lasts all day, though you might want to refresh a bit if you're going out on the town after work. I have sensitive eyes and skin and have no allergic symptoms with NYX. Try the subscription plan to save cents. One pencil lasts me almost 2 months with everyday wear. Hope this helps."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","It's so hard to find makeup online, you're always taking a chance. It is just what I was looking for and it's so nice on. It last until you take it off and it's a nice kinda creamy powder and it rolls up as you get low so that the whole pen is full unlike many other products that are deceiving and don't roll up to get more nor can they be sharpened. I am a permanent customer. Thank you !! PS. Very reasonably priced too !!!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","My favorite eye pencil! Nice and smooth to apply and lasts all day. Actually, it lasts a little TOO well-- it's hard to wash off. Makeup removing wipes seem to work the best. But it's my go-to, even over the expensive makeup store brands. I have them in every color, and buy backups for when I run out. Will continue to buy again and again."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I am impressed!! It works on my oily eyelids with the help of my ""Too Faced""eyeshadow primer.  I usually use ""gel"" eyeliner as most waterproof or smudge-proof eyeliners don't work. I ended up having tons of eyeliners which I used once only.  After 11 hours wearing, This eyeliner still holds well, though I use q-tip to dap away very minor bleeding under my eyes once or twice (this happens even when I wear gel eyeliner).  Now I will stock up all the colors!!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I really like this pure white pencil, and it works for several areas when I need a little more pick-up (brightening) on several places on my face. It is hard to find a pure white pencil, but I am so glad to have it. It came quickly and is a fair price for a long-lasting cosmetic. I have not had it very long so cannot rate its water resistance or how long the pencil will last. I do like it very much. ☺️"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","The NYX Mechanical Eye Pencil in Bronze is beautiful! I like the bronze color with my hazel eyes and blonde hair because it isn't as harsh as black, and even less harsh than the dark browns. It's not quite as light as the taupe I have had sometimes in the past. This eyeliner stays on well over the course of the day."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Fantastic eyeliner!!! I'm an eyeliners snob!! I usually wear Channel.. but I just didn't want to make that 38$ commitment, so I thought I'd try NYX. OMGoodness. It stays put on my waterline better than any pencil I have ever used. It goes on easily enough and unless I cry...it stays PUT. I'm so glad I tried it. Man, am I saving money... it's not boogie... however it is spelled! But, I can get something else I like from Channel now!!! I'm going to be buying this eyeliner from now on!!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I love NYX Cosmetics so I decided to try their Mechanical Eye Pencils for the very first time! I ordered three liners in different shades: Deep Purple (for my upper eyelid); Purple (for my lower eyelid/waterline); and White (for my waterline/inner corner of eyes). Whether creating thick/thin lines or special effects, these creamy & smooth eye pencils delivered a precise application with intense pigmentation! The twist-up tubes required no sharpening, and they were super easy to use. All three colors complimented each other and lasted all day (with a primer). This affordable beauty product outperformed many of the high-end, cosmetic brands I used. And my eyes and contacts didn't experience any irritation or sensitivity while using this product."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I had seen this pencil liner recommended on a beauty blogger's site. While I wear eye liner pencil nearly ever day, I hadn't worn black in a long time. Being age 60, I was a little concerned that a black pencil might be too much on me, but this Nyx pencil is very easily smudged (as long as you do it immediately upon applying the liner) to get just the right level of hardness or softness you want. I have very sparse lashes, to the point of almost having none, so the black pencil smudged to a softer look gives the appearance of a lash line even where there isn't one.  Like the Nyx lip pencils that I love, this eye pencil goes on smoothly without pulling at my skin. It is not dry and flaky like some pencils and it is pretty easy to control to get it where you want and how much you want. The pencil is waterproof so has good lasting power.  Note that this is a mechanical, twist-up pencil NOT a wood pencil that you sharpen the traditional way. As some reviewers have noted, if the tip of this pencil gets too rounded for your needs, you can use a tissue to reshape the tip.  This pencil is super dark black."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I'm no makeup expert but I love lining my water line. I used to spend $28.95 per tube for some liner that dried out one night I left the lid off. This is even better than the designer brand. One quarter the price. It lasts all day. And I mean. all. Day. I put it on at 4am. I work all day at two jobs, cook dinner, run errands, get kids all about, and I still have to use makeup remover at 10pm. If I sweat a lot or have allergies and eyes run, it tends to dissipate in some areas but overall, buy this."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I love how dark of this product is! Definitely quite pigmented. My only qualm with this ( and honestly it's one that I have with most eye liners I've tried) is that it ""melts"" off of my face fairly quickly. I do find myself having to reapply the product and also wiping away under my eye lid several times a day. Again... This is something that I have encountered with just about all eye liner pencils... Doesn't keep me from continuing to test out different one's though! Overall, great pigment, great price, very creamy. Will most likely buy again at some point if I don't find an alternative."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","So I ordered this eyeliner because I have NEVER found one that does not end up under my bottom lashes, smeared all over my under eye area. This one, so far, has remained intact when I apply it. I pencil it in at the base of my lower lashes, just below the water line. I do not line my upper lid. I will admit that I do use a LOT of eye cream under my lower lashes, and to my surprise, I have not experienced smearing of this eyeliner. However, the humid weather is just beginning where I live, so I guess the true tests is yet to come, but so far, I am very satisfied with this eyeliner, Especially since it cost $4 and change. You can't go wrong."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I love this eyeliner! I have tried tons of different black eyeliners for my everyday basic look, and this one has been THE best! The color is great- it's not a dull black which is great. It doesn't wear off quickly like some other eyeliners, and the cost is great. I have re-ordered this 5+ times and will continue to because it's the best one I've found. Would recommend 10/10"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This eyeliner honestly lasts all day! I love using different colored eyeliners to create graphic liner looks, and this eyeliner from NYX is perfect for that. The twist-up function is great, and it's so nice to not have to sharpen my liner. The product glides on easily and doesn't tug at the delicate skin on your eyelids. The color I choose is very pretty and adds a nice pop of color."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I have not used this eye liner pencil yet, but I did test the ease with smoothness of this pencil and it's a gem, I'll be happy with it, it'll get many usage once I begin using it."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I use this in and around my water line every single day, and after a 10+ hour shift, I barely notice any fading. I haven’t gotten much of that black inner eye goop either (I know 😬 I’m sorry), which some liners I’ve tried lately have been horrible with that. It stays in place almost too good bc I have a little trouble creating a smoky eye with it but it does blend out really beautifully with a little patience. I’m very happy to say that I’ve found my forever liner."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",Perfect long wearing under eye high lighter!!!! And it even works on my sensitive allergy eyes. Usually everything makes my eyes water. But this does not. If your like me and want to brighten your eyes check it out!!!
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I really like that this is a mechanical pencil, which means there's a whole lot more product inside the tube! There's almost a whole inch of product, which is a ton more than many of those other types that only contain the product that is shown on the tip of the whole pencil. This NYX mechanical eyeliner pencil is a great buy! I also like that it's very easy to apply, which is important to me as I have a little bit of an unsteady hand."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","It does everything beautifully in terms of ease of application and removal, doesn't smudge or fade, etc. In addition, though, finding such a FANTASTIC medium grey color makes this a true treasure. Most grey eye makeup is either too dark (charcoal) or too light and glittery (silver). This pencil's shade of grey is PERFECT, visible enough to make your eyes look much bigger without looking the least bit harsh OR glitzy. The color works beautifully for daytime and evening. MANUFACTURER PLEASE NOTE: if you ever consider discontinuing this color, I promise to buy whatever remaining inventory you've got!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I like this product. It goes on easily and smooth and I love the built in sharpener. I just knocked it down one star because it does seem to shorten quickly…however, I’ve had issues with the kind you have to sharpen and sometimes the tips break off and they sharpen down very quickly, so I do think this is better."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色", This is the best lip liner I ever used it’s really pretty on my skin tone
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I have always had contacts and had never ever done my water line. Since I've had my LASIK I figured it was time to try this out and I saw the awesome reviews and decided to try this product. It did not disappoint and I was able to do my water line with no problems. I am so excited! Will definitely be purchasing this again many times!!! For that price, how can you NOT buy it!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This has been my go-to purchase for affordable eyeliner for years. PROS: Easy-to-apply / glides on easily, doesn't break or go dull over time, and retains moisture (not a dry, chalk experience). There are other brands with good reputations, but they generally cost more. CONS: May not be a fancy brand title, but that's really about it. Recommend this product for eyeliner needs."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I use this on my waterlines. It works. Is it going to stay for 8 hours? No, but by the end of the day, I didn’t look like a sad clown, so I’m very happy with this purchase. You may have to reapply at some point in the day to keep it nice and dark, but it doesn’t give me raccoon eyes and that’s all I was looking for. I’d order again."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I use a variety of Nyx products, I discovered the brand I was in Switzerland and have continued to look for it in stores since. This eyeliner in particular is easy to put on with the mechanical pencil/auto sharpener. Its longevity, smudge resistance, water resistance etc. is average/good. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could! I can't say too much because I literally just use eye liner and eye shadow most days, occasionally blush and lipstick. I only sometime use a barrier spray which helps prolong the life of it on a day out. I love the colors, I have this pencil in a variety of colors, in the photo I'm wearing a combination of silver and turquoise. The silver looks very silver (and different from the white which I also have)"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I have been using this brand for years. I love it, I just wish the tip was more pointed but I can not complain for the price. It goes on smooth and stays.  EDIT: after using this product for a few months I figured I would update my review. This product falls apart mid application. I end up with big chunks of eyeliner on my eye. It is very frustrating. I am not sure what changed recently with this product but I will not be buying it again."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This is a very good quality eye-liner that helped me create a neat line close to my lashes. It also smudges nicely, so I can create the look I want. As per usual, I applied a dusting of eye shadow over it to keep it fresh throughout the day."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This eye liner became my new favorite a couple of years ago so I was excited to see it on sale here. Unfortunately, the liner keeps breaking almost as soon as it touches my lid. I’ve never had this problem before so I assume it stemmed from the package sitting outside in 90 degree heat. Just beware if you live in a warm climate and aren’t at home to receive packages right away."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Even as inept as I am with my fine-motor movements, I can manage my version of tightlining with this without any problem and quickly. It goes on very smoothly and accurately. I'm 65 so the skin by my eyes isn't the easiest to do things to. I recommend."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","This liner is fantastic! It's the only one I've ever used that has applied smoothly, nice and creamy so it doesn't pull at or irritate your inner eyelid, (water-line) and lasts and lasts! When a tiny bit transfers to beneath your lower lashes during the day, it actually looks Great! This stuff isn't gaudy, yet it had a highly visible, almost ethereal type sheen. If your lower, inner lid (waterline) is pink or red due to age, or whatever, you will love the way this liner looks on you!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Sets nicely after smudging. Lasts all day without transferring to upper lid with no setting powder or spray. I am a hairstylist, I basically steam my face all day."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Ive spent so much time looking for best white eyeliner. NYX is so affordable but theyve had such mixed reviews, especially the ones thatre supposed to sharpened. I decided to try the NYX retractable liners in white and in gold and Im so happy with my decision! They are creamy, apply smoothly and lasted for hours."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","WOW - I am purchasing for the future. Cannot beat the sellers' price - their delivery system and tracking was Stellar, Product, Not allergic to given I am a redhead and truly FABULOUS easy to apply colours. Shopping again to stock up in case the sellers leaves!!!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Let's face it, this may be called NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Mechanical Eye Liner Pencil, but I doubt any professionals are using it. The reason I like this pencil is because it really goes on smoothly. No going over my lid 10,000 times, or needing a lighter to get it going. Just take off the cap, and draw it on. It does smudge; there's no doubt about it, and it can be stubborn getting off, but it's not going to run in the pool or the rain. I'm sure I'll buy it again."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I have sensitive eyes and was worried about trying a new (and, frankly, inexpensive) eye pencil. This is an amazing one! It truly glides on, stays on and washes off easily when you want it to. The color is lovely. (I got a purple.) I will NEVER buy another expensive brand. This is very good quality for a great price. I plan to get more in different colors."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I like the mechanical crayon eyeliners, less waste than the pencil kind and no sharp points of wood. This one is a very pretty color and is easy to put on. It wears fine, I wear it to work and it stays put. I am careful not to touch my eyes though. It is also easy to take off. When this one runs out I'll be buying it again."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","On the model wearing the purple shade the colour is faded so why was I surprised when I tried to use white in my waterline? It has no colour payoff unless you use a heavy hand but then it cakes onto your lashes and looks awful, mascara won’t even cover it because it’s waxy. I guess it doesn’t smudge once left alone but it fades in the waterline"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I love this liner, it’s water resistant but that’s what I need because I mainly put it in my waterline and if you use full on waterproof in your tear ducts you will have cry eyes all night that itch and feel like there is crap in your eyes. Dark as night and lasts, but don’t expect miracles. If you really want cry proof eyes you need eye primer, waterproof mascara and liquid over it. It’s a crime not to prime! You will be golden. P.s that’s from yesterday. I know gross but 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I'd been looking for a teal eyeliner to add a pop of color, but subtle. This is a beautiful navy teal color and I think it would look good on every eye color, all ages. I use it in my waterline and use a brown shadow or smudgy eyeliner on the lower lash line and it's a gorgeous combo of colors together. It glides on creamy and stays put."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","After reading all the reviews about this color, I decided to purchase it and am so glad I did! It is my favorite color eyeliner and my go-to as are the other color eyeliners I purchased from NYX, but I absolutely love the bronze! I highly recommend it and will be buying it again. I just hope they don't stop making it."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","The most perfect creamy, pigmented and easy to put on eyeliner ever. I think most eyeliners are a bit stiff and kind of tug on the eye when you apply it but not this liner! I bought it in black but will be buying it in other colors as well. Also! If you like to smudge your water line, this liner is perfect for that."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I had previously been using a pencil eyeliner from Milano and while I loved it, it tended to smear throughout the day. This one is cheaper and I have noticed holds up longer. I like how with the pencil ones you can easily sharpen them and get finer lines but while I don’t need to sharpen this one, it does mean I get less defined lines and use for more casual everyday looks. Overall recommend, especially considering the cost! Also love that it is another cruelty free product!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I love this eyeliner so much that I bought another one. I've been buying Bare Minerals for years but when they discontinued Lasting Line, I tried this brand. It's better! Never runs or smudges and it's easy to remove at night. Nice and dark with a lovely thin line."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I love this especially for the price! I was buying Neutrogena gel eyeliner and paying $8+ and it didn’t last very long, but then I tried this and it’s even better than any other brand I’ve tried! Goes on easy. Lasts long. Smooth like gel. Does not smear. Will continue to buy this"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I've worn this NYX pencil in bronze for a long time and it's getting harder to find in stores. A lot of times, they have been opened which is really creepy. I'm glad I was able to find it here at a better price."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",I purchased for use at a high school theatre production. We used it to highlight old age makeup and to create hair tufts on the person playing the goat. All the makeup people were in love with this pencil and thanked me repeatedly for purchasing it.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",I like the Laura Geller inkcredible eye pencils but they are pricey and sometimes hard to find. The NYX pencils are a great substitute. The color glides on smoothly and lasts all day. It’s a matte color - no glitter or shimmer. Great for a daytime look. Great price too.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","I love this liner! I can't say enough about this creamy retractable liner. It goes on super smooth and never smears during the day or into the night. It does easily wipe off with water or during a hard sweaty gym workout. If you are prone to watery eyes during allergy season, just forego wearing the liner because it won't stay put."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Great value for the money, it works really well and the color is really deep and beautiful. It goes on easily and lasts my only complaint is that if you press even slightly hard it breaks off very easily."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色",I was looking for an eye pencil that was self sharpening and matte. This is great for me to gently line my eyes and smudge. I was looking more for a subtle highlight and it delivered. So far does not irritate my sensitive eyes.
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","Glides on easy and stays on all day! It does smudge a little, but it's worth it. I don't know why it is so hard to find an eye liner that is soft enough to go on without feeling like I am scraping my eyes out. But this one is good! Definitely recommend!"
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","These are so reasonably priced that I wasn't expecting much but these are just as good, if not better, than the eyeliner pencils I've been paying $25-$30 for! Goes on very smoothly, easy to use and I have not had a problem with smearing. This Bronze color is excellent and I've used it every day since it arrived (I also bought a black pencil but haven't tried it yet). Very happy with this purchase."
"NYX 专业化妆自动眼线笔,黑色","The NYX mechanical eye pencils (but not their regular eye pencils) go on as smooth as silk! The Gypsy blue color shows up more blue on the skin, a very pretty color. Really easy to apply, very creamy, with bright light visible color on the waterline and it STAYED. It did fade slightly later but it has far outperformed all the others I tried."
