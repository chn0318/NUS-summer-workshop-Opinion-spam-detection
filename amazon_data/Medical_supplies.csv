This is right on compared to both a glass and digital thermometer. Takes only a second to work and it even works with a moving target. Highly recommended for the medical professional and for home use, especially with little kids. Stay healthy."
"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",Jenni B,1927,249,"I mainly purchased this for the middle of the night. My littles tend to spike their fevers at night and they always feel like they are 500 degrees. I wanted a way to take their temp without disturbing them. This is PERFECT for that. No beeping, no bright lights, easy to hold and use. That being said, the people complaining about inaccuracy aren't using it in the proper spot. I tested this by measuring different areas of the forehead and they are not all the same temp with or without a fever. You need to aim it at the center of the forehead about a fingers width away and you'll be all set!"
"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",Steve,8382,549,"I doubt that that anybody will read my little review, it'll be pushed so far back in the several thousand nobody will see it. Anyway I hope that it is read because this is the best one that I have purchased, since this crises began. This thermometer works as it is said to. It's very simple and easy to use and it perfectly accurate.  I had a much more expensive one and it didn't work after a few uses. This one doesn't have the memory data and piled up useless stuff to make it tear up quickly. It feels good in the hand, doesn't feel like thin cheap plastic and performs everything but what it is needed for. It's heavier, more solid, reads the temp in a second and shuts off in 8 seconds. It doesn't stay on a half day and drain the battery. It looks and feels like a professional instrument, not a cheap light plastic toy. If it continues to function the way that it's doing, it is worth every penny and is a fair price. As things are now, I would buy it again. I am telling you the honest total truth, this is a good one. Not colored or fancy looking, just a plain simple, well made instrument that does what it is supposed to do...  11-18-20 This one that I have reviewed is still just like the day that I received it. So, I bought another one, for a gift...……."

And the device is very good looking! So simple to operate with one button, and it vibrates to alert you the testing is done. Accurate and not expensive at all."
"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",IntiMD - Public Relation,407,2,"Decided to replace the trusty Braun thermoscan ear thermometer that we bought back in 2007 when our first child was born. The Thermoscan wasn't broken, just that it feels outdated. This No-Touch thermometer is really well-designed. Simplistic, and intuitive to use.  Daughter just came down with a mild cold, and we have been using both the old Thermoscan and this No-Touch thermometer to see if there is any difference in the reading. While this is not a affirmative test for accuracy, both thermometers' readout are within 0.3 F of each other, so we are fairly confident that both of these are good for their function.  Using the No-Touch thermometer:  While holding the No-Touch thermometer close to forehead (without touching), press the button once to activate. Once the No-Touch thermometer vibrates, the scan is complete.  There are similar No-Touch thermometers out there for a bit cheaper, but I enjoy the design of this particular model."

I bought this to check my temperature before work every morning in light of the recent pandemic. Would never register above 97.3; however, when I rechecked at the office one day my temperature was approaching 100.  I received a refund (from Amazon not manufacturer) for the item, and I realize that sometimes things break. The reason for the negative review is the manufacturer’s response to my refund request. Their response “ It's impossible for this device can never register above 97.3. But we hope to know if you had used it correctly by following the instruction. How about reload the batteries” The response continued with angry veiled references about Amazon for refunding my money.  Great grammar, huh? But I must be too stupid to put in batteries correctly. I emailed the company again with the above pictures to show that the batteries had been installed correctly otherwise the display would not light up with the temperature reading. Still waiting for response. . ."

Then when the kids told me they didn't feel well, it was 98.1-99.1. I am not going to wait 30 minutes, and move room to room to see if I can get a different reading. It is garbage.

This one is quite accurate (I have compared the temperature to my oral & the ear ones), & extremely fast, less than a second for a reading. I love it, because it is the only one that's non-touch yet accurate. Easy to use too, with no waiting for a reset. Overall a great buy, esp for this price. The touched forehead thermometer that I purchased before this one was almost twice the price, & there's a wait for the reading."

I have only gotten a read by touching it directly to the skin. My husband and I have attempted multiple times, starting about an inch away from the skin and gradually moving closer and trying again. Secondly, in the product description on Amazon it specifically states, ""FDA cleared"" but in the actual user's manual it specifically states, ""The device is not FDA cleared."" False advertising."

Sending back as defective.  UPDATE [2 Aug 2020]: I could calculate what my temperature was based on this device being consistently off by half a degree.  NOW it's telling me my temperature is around 92.4°F. THAT'S RIDICULOUS!!!!

I was expecting the readings to be a little lower than actual temperatures given that its contactless and not an internal body temp measurement. But the readings are almost always well over 100 degrees (on multiple people and dozens of attempts). I've followed directions regarding placement and tried variations, as well. It's NOT useful. What a WASTE OF MONEY."
"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",George Kramer,1303,50,Really inaccurate thermometer. I had better expectations from Xiaomi whom I believe is the manufacturer of this product. It's consistently about 1-1.5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the doctor's office. Which IMHO is not acceptable. Sadly my return window is up and I am stuck with something that literally cannot even be used as a paperweight.
"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",M. Anderson,56,17,"I've only had this thermometer for a week and no one has been sick in our household but here is my experience with this device. This is the easiest thermometer that gives the quickest reading hands down of any thermometer I've ever used. I've tested it on 4 different people (different age groups) in my household including myself. I've taken my temperature about 8 times this week just to practice and test the device out. The temperature readings have always been between 97.9 and 99.2 which seems normal - I don't have another thermometer to compare these numbers against, but the range is close enough for my family. The manual came in several languages but English was the primary language. The device is very easy to use - just aim it at the bridge of your nose between your eyebrows, press and hold the button, wait for the device to vibrate, and then look at the reading. My only complaint would be that I wish it came with a small pouch to put the thermometer in. It's not really a big deal - we keep ours in the medicine cabinet but since it's not a device that's not used very often (only when someone's sick or not feeling well), it would be nice to have a small pouch to keep it stored in. Overall, this is an amazing thermometer that works as advertised. I would highly recommend this device if you are in the market for a no touch thermometer."

"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",john,66,24,"Though it's just one button and seemingly simple enough to operate. Most people become frustrated with getting this to work. No one should need to read instructions for something so simple unless for changing settings like celcius or fahrenheit.  I purchased several of these for the company I work for and use it to test employee temperatures. I still haven't read how to operate it but I got it right away. I had to explain this (without reading instructions) to 80% of the users - 1) push button to turn it on 2) get it really close to your forehead (like an inch), 3) push and hold button until it vibrates...done!  I believe you have to get so close is because it seems to be very directional. If it's flat purple cap isn't parallel to the forehead, it won't read. I think the angle of the handpiece in relation to the scanner head causes some people to hold the handle parallel to the face, therefore causing the scanner to be slightly pointed to the sky.  Once I get people to see how simple it is to use and keep them from throwing it on the floor, it's all good times.  Good thing it's not a heart rate or blood pressure monitor because everyone would fail.  One reason I was hesitant about purchasing this was because of the apparent lack of contrast on the display. White character read-out on a white body and a white screen seems counter intuitive but there is NO problem with this display. It reads loud and clear."

Overall Consumer Rating Group Size was Accomplished by Almost 121,000 Consumers. The majority of its Ratings was very Positive. I also purchased an Oral Under the Tongue Thermometer, which was also Highly Approved by Consumers (Over 70,000 Consumer Rated). The No Touch Thermometer was very quick in obtaining my Forehead Temperature. Tested the Thermometer 50 times over a 2 week period. All temperatures were obtained within a 1 to 2 second time frame and was lightning fast. I also Used my New Oral Thermometer as a Backup Reference. Both the No Touch Digital Thermometer and the Oral Digital Thermometer were within .1 of each other. In fact, most of the readings compared with each other were Exactly the same. I will admit I studied at least 20 various Digital Thermometers over a 3 month time frame. All have in common the same complaints, They take too long to display a reading, They are Not Accurate, They Quit Working after a Couple of Months. My Reasoning States, Find any item you want to purchase and then look at the Largest Consumer Group that Rated the Desired Item. Discover What Ratings they gave the Item. Read the Good and Bad Reviews on the item. In the End, as in my case, 117,000 Consumers Out of Almost 121,000 Consumers, Rated the Thermometer 5 Stars, I feel the Product is Probably Worth Owning and Trustworthy. Of Course Life as Well as Consumer Products can be Lemons. If this Happens to you, exchange for another product. So far the Thermometer is Functioning Perfect!

Arrived in a few days during covid, so we were very lucky to get it so quick! It’s sleek and cool looking lol not that it matters at all for a thermometer but it is cool. It works on me, my husband, my son. And I can take temps while little guys asleep. This temp I took about 4 times because I was trying to take a picture. Only advice is hold it close, don’t need to touch but close. It’ll vibrate and boom, 1 second read!"

If I had rated this 10 days ago, I probably wouldn't rate too high. Initially, we had problems getting this thing to work. About one out of 4 tries, it would work. The manual text is so small, I don't know if anyone can read it. The real trick is to place right between your eyes and raise an inch, then press the button. It still will not read my wife's temperature. I just tell her ""you're dead"". But, it did seem to work accurately, despite the negative reviews. After my fever passed, it has read within a 1/10th of a degree at 98.6. Easy to read, it the dark or in light. Feels comfortable in the hand. Lightly vibrates when ready to read, if you're checking your own temp. Also, read a review about it being expired. I have no idea why a digital device would have an expiration, but mine is about 3 years from now. Nice to have around, and a good price."

"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",J. L. Strouble,279,24,"I love this little no-touch forehead thermometer. I bought it for a family member who is almost 99 years old and in hospice. She has coughing and gagging issues so an under the tongue thermometer would be difficult for her to use. It's smaller than I thought it would be, very sleek and ergonomic and not bulky at all. It's very easy to operate and easy to read. It takes a temperature within seconds. There are no ""bells & whistles"" (like a memory of past readings or a storage case), which is just what I wanted. These IR thermometers are pricey but this one is very reasonable compared to the other choices. I can't speak to the accuracy because we had nothing to compare it to, but I took reading after reading on everyone who stopped by the house and they were all within reason. Sometimes it seemed to get stuck on one reading for three consecutive tries on different people, but then the fourth would be a different number. All my ""subjects"" were sitting at rest in close proximity and this is a skin temperature reading, not an internal reading, so it's quite possible that, at normal body temperature, the ambient temperature would exert an influence on everyone's forehead and yield a similar temperature. I'm going to assume that it's accurate enough to tell the difference between a baseline temp and a fever but if I were reporting an elevated temperature to any medical personnel I would make sure they understood that it's a forehead reading. I would highly recommend this model to anyone who needs an IR thermometer."
"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",the-big-bend,1453,196,"There are those that look like a pistol which promises more functions. However they all tend to be bigger and more expensive. This one is small making it easy to store in the medicine cabinet and carry with you on a trip. It is simple and quick to use and looks nice and elegant. I assume one must operate it correctly to ensure consistency and accuracy. I measured myself three times and the variations were less than 0.2 °F within the spec. I use it to monitor my temperature in the time of COVID-19 even at home as per my company's guideline. This thermometer makes this daily task a breeze.  A few things to add after reading some negative reviews: First, as you compare this to your ""old and trusted"" existing thermometer, do not assume the existing one is more accurate. For one, your ""other"" thermometers most likely do not measure temperature at the forehead so they will return different readings. Second, I am a biologist and know scientific thermometers from different brands/batch can vary temperature readings by as much as 1.5 °C. The mercury ones are more accurate. So the key is to establish your baseline and then assess whether your current reading is substantially above. No matter which part of your body you measure, >100°F indicates fever. Finally you have to point this at the same spot to get consistent reading. The instruction also says the optimal distance to your forehead is about 1 inch."
"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",lotsaresearch,73,100,"This is easy to hold and feels good in your hand. The readings seem very consistent and are easy to read. I have trouble hearing high pitch sounds so the vibration this emits in your hand when the reading is confirmed works great for me. Although most of the no touch thermometers seem to have a switch to turn off the sound, if you do that then seeing the display is the only way to know the reading has been made. If you’re checking your own temperature you’d need to stand in front of a mirror to confirm a reading. Or if you’re checking a child’s temperature in bed the vibration would be convenient to know the temperature has been recorded. This doesn’t store temperatures so if you think that’s important you might want to get a different thermometer.  Edit: I liked the first one I ordered so much that I bought 3 more for all the members of the family. It is so much easier to pick it up and check your temperature easily in these days of Covid. I never knew my temperature was so consistent. Although it seems to be about a degree low, I’ll definitely know if my temperature starts going up. Love it!"

Per CDC and the ask of the school we take daily tempertures. It caught my covid. I had a consistent daily temp of 97.3 which by definiton is normal.  Googled At MGH, the TAT is set to ARTERIAL or CORE mode, so a normal temperature is 97.4 -100.1°F. TAT is set to CORE temperature; therefore results are NOT comparable to an oral temperature and are NOT interchangeable with oral temperatures. Precision of the TAT is driven by proper technique.  The day my temp registered 99.1 I knew I had been exposed to something.  The thermometer is easy to use. I had purchased a second thermometer for my 82 year old dad to self monitor too. His base line is a bit higher so it is important to establish a base line for each family member."

For that reason, I already have one thermometer that reads by touching and dragging across the forehead for a reading. At the time I thought this was the best option for little ones but it’s readings are so different each time, even when I use it back to back (from 99.5-104.2 sometimes!) Those are vastly different and one scarier than the other! So I decided to get another thermometer. I usually buy products based off of reviews. Honestly there were mixed reviews on this one. But you always have to take reviews with a grain of salt meaning that most people won’t leave a review unless they’re upset or super love it. And many people may love a product but don’t want to take the time to leave a review beyond giving it a star-rating. But I kept doing research on other thermometers and found they all had mixed reviews. So I took a chance on this one because of the features offered. I loved that it’s touchless (thinking Covid). I loved that it didn’t beep when it was complete (thinking of a sleeping child). (It even comes with its own batteries-it’s the small things right?) But most importantly are the readings. Right now my children are healthy. When I tried it out on them, not only was it consistent, but it was accurate! And it read differently on each of us, again all in the normal realm but it changed between each of us but kept the same reading as the last time that forehead was scanned. So right now, this product has my full confidence. I’ll update this post if I find otherwise. I would recommend trying this one out if you need a thermometer for a young child or just need a good touchless thermometer for Covid reasons."

"iHealth 无触摸式额头温度计,成人和儿童数字红外温度计,非接触式婴儿温度计,3 个超敏感传感器,大型 LED 数字,静音振动反馈,无接触",Dave,6,19,"All thermometers are a little subjective... meaning, there are a few different ways to actually measure your body temperature, and this devices uses only one of those methods - it’s measuring the IR temp of the temporal artery in your forehead. But the most important and WONDERFUL thing about this thermometer is that it is extremely consistent!! (When isolating, due to Covid-19 symptoms, I used 2 different thermometers and always got erratic and Highly questionable measurements. It made me a little crazy for a while. Until I got this device I couldn’t be sure what my temp was. Using this device my measurements were consistent from one measurement to another... maybe +/- 0.5 degrees - which is pretty darn good. When it indicated a decreasing temp, and I measured 2 or 3 more times just to be sure, it always measured the same temp, validating that my temp was indeed going down... likewise when it increased). Apparently some thermometers (the more sophisticated ones) attempt to make corrections to forehead measurements to estimate, or simulate, core temperature - this one does not. Generally speaking, so I’ve read, forehead measurements with devices like this one are about 1 degree lower than core temp; but that’s OK if you know that’s what you are seeing. In our household, when everyone is well, this device measures between 97.1 and 97.3 degrees F (a little more than 1 degree below average body temp of 98.6F). That body temp can vary between age groups, activity, time of day, metabolism, environment, etc - it’s important to know what normal is for your family ahead of time. I recommend that you measure known healthy people in your household BEFORE judging weather someone has a fever or not. In other words, find out what normal temp is in your household, before you put your faith in (any) device. For our household I add about 1 degree (1.3 degrees to be more precise) get a more realistic estimate of (core) body temp. So when I get a measurement of 97.3, I know that’s “normal” around here. But, if I get a measurement of 98.6 with this device, I have reason to believe That it’s really 99.9 degrees F... possible cause for concern. Of course I would monitor it closely to see if it goes up another 0.5 degree, which would be 99.1 as measured on this device, and , hence (99.1 + 1.3), closer to 100.4 actual core body temp; which would officially be a fever. Note... This is the same device they use at Kaiser Permanente when you walk through the door to go to the pharmacy, or whatever (along with a very sophisticated and much more powerful device that measures everyone from a distance); Kaiser got EXACTLY the same measurement (97.3 F) of my temperature, with the same device, that I got with ours at home. That’s a powerful endorsement!"

I know what my temperature normally runs, and fortunately the iHealth readings always come in around the right area. With the iHealth I can trust that we're all OK, and that we'll know when we're not.

In fact, press it once briefly, release it, then press again. So actually 2 presses. Super easy, once you figure that out."

The iHealth brand is what our doctor's office used and the reviews for this model looked good. I can't speak to absolute accuracy since we don't have another thermometer to compare with this one, but it reads within a few tenths of a degree of what I would expect on a healthy person. Perhaps even more importantly, it reads consistently within a couple tenths on subsequent checks. The thermometer is not overly sensitive to position or distance from the forehead, which is very important when attempting to check an infant that won't hold still. The device is easy to use, met expectations, and is reasonably priced. Glad I went with this model."

Last night we took our son to the ER because this thermometer read 104-105 several times in a batch of about ten readings (I think sometimes you get a low reading/normal reading from user error). Once we got to the ER and he got a rectal temp (maybe half hour later), that reading was 105.4. So I feel safe in knowing this thermometer can read the right temp, you just have to take several readings, and whatever the most consistent, highest reading is, is most likely his temp. The reason we were even able to get my son's temp, unlike with our first normal oral thermometer (our second thermometer was a forehead one that just read the same number over and over), is because this one reads in literally a second. You don't even touch his forehead, it vibrates, and you get a reading. Our son struggled with us at first with it, being all curious and wanting to grab at it, but being such a quick and easy way to temp he finally gave in to letting us temp him without obstacle. Definitely recommend this thermometer."

I feel that this is a little less than 1 degree off. 97.8 when I used it but much better than the digital ones which were telling me my temperature ranged from 95.2 to 101 when I didn’t even have a fever!

If only the other ones could keep it simple like this one and just deliver the results. No need for three colors, different modes, ergonomic design, apps for phones, or any of that stuff, at the end of the day all I want is a reliable tool to read the temperature. I know this one delivers great results because I know my average body temperature as I take regular readings at work, and when I check at home it is also spot on! Before making my decision and going for this sleek design (which I love), I read tens of thousands of reviews of the best rated and best selling thermometers on-line, both on and off Amazon, and this was by far the best reviewed one. I almost paid double the price of this one in favor of one that syncs with Apple Health and has a super cool design, but after careful consideration and reading the horrific reviews, I gave in to reason: why on earth would I need to spend almost 100 dollars on a thermometer that only works connected to WiFi just so I can have its readings sync up to an app that actually takes readings manually as well? Senseless. Long story short: buy this guy, keep it simple, be satisfied."

You put in the 2 enclosed batteries and turn it on with a push of the button. You have to hold it no further than 1 inch or 3 cm away from the forehead. It will vibrate in your hand when the temp is ready and it shows the temperature right away on the screen. It is easy to see and to read and to use this. It is good to take your baseline temperature when you are healthy so you know what your normal body temperature is. Mine and my husbands were both the same at 97.3 and 97.5 the two times we tested it. Then I also tested my forehead temperature on another forehead thermometer that is by contact where you slide it across your forehead by touch and it gave me the same exact temperature. So that was good as I knew this new no contact infrared one was then accurate. I wrote down our ""Normal"" temperature and will keep the note in the box so I know what our baseline temperature normally runs, in case one day we feel ill. It says on the directions that this is for ""people of all ages"". It also states that it can be used for babies, children, and adults. It does not come with a carrying case, so i will just keep it in the holder and in the box that it came with as it is not too large. I like this as it is quite simple to use, which is what I wanted."

What I've found is if you're in a cool room it won't be. I tried it on my forehead and I got 97.3, the palm of my hand 97.5, and then I tried it in my arm pits, and it hit 98.6. If you have a fever it will probably work just about anywhere on the body, but when not, the ambient temperature of the room affects your bodies skin surface temperature. For those who haven't tried it yet, put it in your armpit, close your arm, push the button, and you should get a normal body temperature reading. I looked it up. Body temperature can vary across different body parts. So I say the instrument is quite accurate."

With traditional digital thermometers,there’s only two ways to check a baby’s temp, rectally and under the armpit. I wasn’t about to stick something in my newborns bottom so I always checked by placing it in her armpit. Well after serval days I realized her temp was reading 96-97.5 and that’s way too low for in newborn and we even took her to the E.R. to see if she was sick. Come to find out with babies the armpit temps are always low and not as accurate and I didnt know that. So I order this handy dandy sleek forehead thermometer and it’s been amazing.

It required moving the thermometer across the forehead from temple to temple with skin contact. It was also useable for ear measurements. I found it disappointing because the readings according to the amount of pressure one applied when moving the lens from temple to temple. So, the accuracy was determined to some extent by variations connected with the user. I also did not like the need to have skin contact. So, I searched around for an infrared non-contact forehead thermometer and was bewildered by the large number available with many having both good and bad reviews. I eventually settled on this thermometer. Fortunately, I have not had much cause to use it. However, it is so easy to use compared to the other thermometer that I am delighted with it. The readings are consistent and reliable. The design is excellent and the readouts are large and easy to see. I highly recommend this thermometer."

A thermometer is a must have...especially with a wife who’s a nurse and with everything health-wise going on these days. Hold this thing close to the forehead, push the button in and you get a reading in about 1 second. This thing looks good, feels good, and is accurate (we’ve tested with an additional thermometer). We’ve used multiple thermometers in the past. The head scanner that you run across the forehead...no good. In-ear thermometers...actuate, but expect a battle. Rectal thermometers...very accurate, but expect a war. This is the easiest one out of all of them. We find it especially useful when we need the quick “I don’t feel that great” check...ie man cold.

I've always been leery of under the tongue thermometers, but gauged this one against my old under the tongue one, and both registered the same.; hence it's accurate.

This is great for taking temps of sleeping babies or children. There is no noise to wake them up! the only thing that would really make this better in my mind would be a case.

I work at a hospital, I have to check my temp everyday before work. This has made it easier on me considering I take pills in the morning for my health issues which in return give a false read after cold liquid is in my mouth. Obviously I'm not sitting in front of heat blowing in my face when I scan my forehead, or sitting outside in the cold. But I tested it on 3family members at different times and the degrees in temp changed by .1 or .2 I am very satisfied"

Checked her again with this one and it said 98.3 again, I got this to check temps over night so I didn’t have to bother my kids’ ears but it’s obviously not accurate in the slightest. I’m pretty sure I’m outside of my return window and I’ve thrown the box away so I’m pretty mad  Update: The company reached out and sent me a replacement, this one seems to be working better than the first, hopefully now we will have non eventful night time fever checks"

If you don’t like a lot of bells & whistles, this is probably perfect for you. I’m not 100% sure it’s accurate, but readings are very consistent. For example, if I take my temperature 3 times in a row, it shows the same temperature all 3 times. I will try to test it by comparing it to a mouth thermometer & posting my results."

We have to take our temps twice a day at work and this is great because it's non touch so we don't have to disinfect it after each person. This one is for the house though. We have a disabled son who rarely gets sick, but when he does it's so hard to take his temp. He hates it. We could never use an oral thermometer on him and we had one that you put up to the temple but it took a while to get a temp and he was already pulling away from it. This one, just point, shoot, and done. The cost was good on this one too and it was in stock which was another plus."

The worst thing is having to hold your toddler still (impossible) through crying or wake them up in the middle of the night to take their temp. We even had a forehead thermometer but it has to actually touch the skin and makes a loud beep sound. This one will be perfect for those middle of the night temp checks. I also LOVE the attractive sleek design. My only criticism would be that it needs to come with a storage case. It says on the instructions to store it in the box to keep the sensor from getting dirty or scratched but the box is much bulkier than the device itself, which is slim. If it could just come with a nice little carry bag, that would be much better"

And get this, it also works for other things than covid. I know, crazy right. It will tell your temperature if you catch the flu or food poisoning. What else you ask? Well, it will take your temperature if you have a STD or if you recently got stabbed with a sword. This may all sound fantastical, but let me assure you, it is not.

The readings we're getting are aligned with the stick thermometers we had been using previously and with the readings we're getting from other infrared devices at our employers' locations. It's easy to use -- one-touch in a second or two. It's forehead only, without a code for in-ear readings, but that's fine for our purposes, and it makes for a sleeker device. The only negative surprise is that the box indicates a made-on date and an expiration date (about two years from now). I'm not sure whether that's just for this thermometer or whether it other infrared thermometers have use-by dates; they're all medical devices, and they all have to be calibrated, so perhaps the accuracy of the calibration is time-limited. In two years I'll have to monitor whether it's still accurate; if not, I'll need to get a replacement."

Still, it often required multiple readings as a fidgeting child or a botched drag across the forehead can yield wildly different results.  When I saw this Infrared thermometer I was sold. It doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles (bluetooth, internet connected, AI to tell me if the temperature means a fever) but it does the one thing it was designed to do very well, and it does so at a very reasonable price. Fast, accurate and consistent reading across multiple readings (I used the older temporal thermometer for reading comparisons). I don't know how we ever lived without one, and every time another parent sees it in action they want one too - I don't think there's a better endorsement."

The PT3 is easy to use. I put my finger on my forehead to guide it to the right distance, and pushed the button. It took just a few seconds until I felt the vibration notice that it was ready. I especially liked the very large size of the numbers and the fact that there is nothing else displayed except the temperature. There is no way to be confused. It is interesting that there is no window. It just appears on the surface of the devise. The only thing that was a problem, the manual is impossible to read because it is so small (just as many products' manuals are). Fortunately, it is available online. Originally, it was the same size as the booklet that came with the device, but I was able to print it at 170%, and it fit just right on seven sheets of 8.5"" x 11"" paper, and I could easily read it."

It is simple to use, hold it up to your forehead, press the button and your temperature lights up which you can readily see when you turn it around.

The iHealth is easy to use, truly touch less. I tried it on myself and husband over several days, works perfectly. I tried it on my 1 month old grand daughter and worked great.

"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Queenie,138,69,"I ran out of manly colored masks for my guys. I found these and they are content with the color and since they have to wear them 8+ hours daily, they survived wearing them. Thank you."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",amazonian,52,20,"I regret this purchase. The whole thing is super sketchy. The masks come in a package with no brand-name, no manufacturer, no address or city, no identifying information of any kind. Only a barcode and “made in China“. These are NOT 3-ply. I questioned whether they were and compared them very carefully to another surgical mask I had purchased that is 3-ply (with manipulation you can feel the three layers). These ones are definitely not. Additionally when compared to another surgical mask so much more air passes through these ones compared to a proper 3 ply surgical mask. I do not think these are going to be effective. Perhaps if you wear two of them at a time… but they seem pretty worthless. Don’t buy! False advertising is the biggest of red flags.  And as I saw another reviewer mention, it's nearly impossible to tell one side from the other. So good luck putting it back on the right direction and not contaminating yourself!"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",NeO,41,30,"Awful. Way too small for an average size adult face. Also disliked not being able to distinguish between sides. If you take off the mask to eat, make sure you remember which side was exterior facing so as not to contaminate yourself. Returned the product because there are way better disposable masks out there."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",AmazonPrime,114,75,"Pros: Comfortable Grey color Fits face  Cons: Horrible chemical odor you constantly are breathing in.  𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲: I've changed my score from 1 star to 5. The chemical odor goes away once they sit out of the bag it comes in. I had to let mine sit for a week+ individually. I wore one today at the doctors office, zero odor."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Aracely salazar,7,61,"I read the reviews and they weren’t grate but I still bought it ,200 for the price it’s not bad . Really good quality they are not as thin as other ones I had purchased , I’m really satisfied with the quality and they fit perfect !!"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Tia Gorecki,52,24,I wear them everyday. They have a weird smell when you open the package but it goes away and you can’t smell it when wearing the mask. You can have the perks of a disposable mask while looking more put together
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Daisy Brooks,18,4,"I order the one on the left months ago and I love it. If you can tell, left is dark grey and thicker. The one on the right is so light and I dont like it at all. I just thought if I “click” reorder; which I did; I thought I would get the same thing I ordered but I didnt and Im very upset. Still 100pcs. Just 2 stars because this is not what I expected and its very light weight mask compare to the first order I got which has layers"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Texas mom,756,548,"I made the switch to these black masks from the plain blue kind and really like them! These are great to keep everywhere in case you forget- I have them in the glove compartments in our cars, in the bottom of my purse, etc. Super convenient and these are comfortable. Good quality, well made."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Sarah S,3,38,"The masks fit better than others of a similar material. I’m a healthcare professional, so I’ve been wearing masks nearly nonstop for the past few years. These masks fit on my face better than the blue or yellow ones offered at work, the ear loops are sturdier and don’t break as easily."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Amazon Customer,4,11,"Awesome product, also came with a resealable bag for storage. No complaints what so ever. I counted the number of masks, and I came up one short, but hey I am not too confident with my counting skills so there is that. Would definitely buy from this seller again."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Trisha,2,19,"I would not get any other kind of masks but this brand. I absolutely love it!! So comfortable material & comfortable to work in, I can go all day without a problem!! My work has the regular yellow or blue masks. They’re so uncomfortable & the fibers detach & feel like I breathe them in . They’re so hard to breath in while working & are cheap for sure!"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Kenneth,13,22,I got them because I particularly like this disposable face masks and I really like the black ones because they don’t get dirty after constant adjustments (compared to regular blue or white ones where you get fingerprints or just general dirt marks around your nose) the amount was nice and I keep a bunch in my car and the rest at home. Very much recommended 👍🏻
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",D. Martin,14,25,"I don't know what other people are referring to that they have a smell because mine doesn't have any smell. They work great and are a great size for larger faces. I have 50 in the house for use as needed, and I threw 50 in my car glove compartment. That way I always have some on hand when needed. Would definitely buy it again."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Gwyn,286,60,"These are sturdy, comfy & fit well - the nose piece is bendy but strong. We ordered another brand when this was out of stock & we donated those & bought these that had just come back in stock. We will only be buying this brand from now on (so long as they don't change anything!)."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Evy,289,217,"Excellent quality, comfortable and affordable masks. I admire and respect your company for getting back to me quick. Excellent customer service. Very responsable. That tell everything about a company wants to do for their customers. Will recommend You to everyone I know."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Eva,50,70,"These are my go to masks since I have to wear them all day at work. They're comfortable and I just tie a little loop if I need a more tight fitting. The price is reasonable, they were delivered quickly and black is an easy color. I'd buy them again and would recommend this product."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Cecily,2,6,I guess people can’t read because it says to let it air out due to vacuum seal to me smells more like glue but I will let it air out then see how it goes from there pretty good to me heavy duty and the smelll is already going away. Pretty satisfied! 🙂
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Denise,47,26,I purchased the grey ones. These are pretty decent disposable masks for the price you pay. It has a dark grey color on one side and white filter on the other side. They hold up pretty well and are sturdy. After a while any mask on your face is going to get uncomfortable but these are decent I will end up purchasing again.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Linda,4,7,I tried a few black disposable masks and this brand for me I found to be very reliable. The thickness compared to other black disposable masks is better and it feels like a better protection. The material is standard and somewhat thick where we feel protected but easy enough to breathe. I would recommend these masks. I bought a 50 pack and surprised by the quality I ordered another 200 pack.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Amazon Customer,26,59,My family seems to love these masks more than any others. Lightweight and easier to breathe through. The two things I don't like are: they are disposable and I don't feel the fit isn't always tight enough (although that's apparently the reason one of my children likes them).
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Friendofall,15,22,"After three tries I finally found a black medical grade mask that is lightweight, fits snuggly, and covers my face properly. They are reasonably priced as well. I was so tired of wearing the blue masks and since I wear a lot of black these were a no brainer. I don’t think anyone will be disappointed with this product."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Carla Smyers,51,62,My 14 yr old son picked these out to wear to school. He loves them and so do I. The bands aren’t tight so they pull your ears. That’s a plus! Plus the nose piece is very moldable and stays in place! Definitely recommend! Planning on offering more very soon.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Brendon,44,27,"I bought these when there was a deal going on. I really like them. I do wish they were individually wrapped, but I doubt any masks are. They have a metal piece that bends on your nose and it seems to work well! Worth the money especially with Covid."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",J. L. Knox,475,437,These seem to be just a little larger and have bigger more elastic ear loops than a lot of the paper masks I’ve bought. The material is soft and not itchy on your face. Definitely a step above most disposables. I’ll order these again next time.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",DR,1,11,"Disappointing that the masks arrived in opened, possibly contaminated packaging. Both the outer packing, as well as the packaging that holds the actual masks were opened. The package also contains less than the amount on the product description."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",John,13,23,These are lightweight and more comfortable than n95 to wear for extended periods in my opinion. The black color now seems to be the dominant color worn and is so prevalent that it's almost not noticeable since the mask wearing public is or was the norm. I didn't think I'd have to get these but now glad I did since masking requirements have returned.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Firefly,4,20,These masks are the best ones I have found. I am so over wearing my cloth ones and I am so tired of the blue ones furnished by my employer hurting my ears. I can wear these all day with no pain behind my ears.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",LISA FIGURA,102,326,Finally a mask that fits perfectly. I am a woman with a fairly small face and these are great. The kids masks are too small and the adult masks were always too large. These are perfect and what a great price!
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",christie,154,253,These masks are great to leave in your vehicle in case you forget to grab a nicer one. I like that they aren't the blue/white ones that are everywhere. They do not scratch like the blue/white ones either.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Taijena,8,20,"I am satisfied with my purchase, plus I could not beat the price of $6 for 100 masks. The mask are comfortable,lightweight, black and last all day. On the package it does mention not for medical use so I don't suggest these mask for nurses, medical assistant, doctors, etc."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Jacqui,15,51,"The masks are light-weight and easy to breathe through. You can hardly tell you're wearing it. They have a bendable nose piece which helps with keeping my glasses fog-free. There's a bit of a weird smell to them, but it's not bad. Price is good."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Ariella M.,73,22,"Love these masks! Very lightweight, breathable, and sleek looking. I like how they fit my face(not too big, not too small) I liked them so much I ordered a second package of them. It’s nice to have so many on hand. Never know when someone will need one."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Tay,4,16,"No strange smell, good quality and light weight. Only thing I would change is the packaging. It's one bag with 50 loose mask, no plastic wrap or anything. I normally keep a pack in my car in my center console but these don't fit in the package, so I ended up taking them out and storing them in a zip lock bag... other than that, works for our needs and they also fit out preteens perfectly."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Honest Amazoner,4,6,"My son has been wearing a reusable mask but I purchased these disposables for school as a backup. These are lightweight and comfortably fit his narrow face without any alterations. The masks we received have zero smell which was a relief after reading other mask reviews. Even though the price was slightly higher, very happy with purchase and would definitely buy again."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",GuadalupeG,4,30,"Great price. Well made. Grandchildren use them, while out among others and at school."

"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",shortie,11,34,"Pretty standard feeling mask. FYI It does seem to run larger than normal. Works out well for my larger & bearded husband, but less so for my own small face. It's fine though; he wears these and I have different ones."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Erin Murray,2,16,"I have had such a hard time finding masks that fit correctly. They're either too big or small, but these were the perfect fit. I'm not constantly pulling it up or fighting a headache from the straps digging into my ears. I'm disappointed I found these so late in the game but these will be my new go to for the rest of the pandemic!"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Michelle,154,158,"Very comfortable and lightweight. Ear loops are not too tight as some have been in the past. Great value, best price I’ve gotten for black masks. Shipped to my house fast. No weird smell either."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",morningstar,27,65,"The Kn95 masks fit so they're not tight over your nose and mouth, that makes it easier to breath withou pulling something up tight against your face which will make it harder to breathe."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Como22,89,48,"My daughter stills wants to wear a mask in school but typically disposable masks are too bug for her, but these fitted her and all of us perfectly. So far all of them are in perfect condition."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",MandyL,9,27,"We really like these masks, just bought a second pack of them. Fit me, my husband, and 8 year old just fine-my son just needs to twist the ears. Pass the candle test. Only thing that would be better is if the inside was white. Would be easier for my son to tell how to put it on. Overall very pleased."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Mdurb,6,21,I personally think these are crap they are so thin you can see light thru them. However my husbands loves them because the ear loops are extremely stretchy. And he gives them away to passengers when he drives for Ride sharing. He wears one of these and then his nfl face mask over it.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",JDForrest,8,47,Really liked this mask. I have broad face and the ear loops were long enough as to not hurt the backs of my ears. I wear them in the bakery where I work and they are very effective . I would recommend them to anyone
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",AshleyH,4,25,These masks don’t irritate my ears and hides some of the makeup rub off. They are durable also. I don’t think I have had one break (other brands always). I wear these all day at work. I wear glasses and as long as the mask is pulled up enough they don’t fog up.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Delma Johnson,3,33,These are not thick the way the other black masks were. That’s why I ordered some more although not the same vendor. They look like they were going to be thick but they were very thin. And they have a weird scent to them. I did like the price for 100 masks though.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",kcwalsh1,20,26,"Daybreak primary school up in battle Ground Washington told my neighbor’s kids that flag apparel depicting rainbows and certain movements are allowed but the United States flag is not. They wanted to make a statement, so I bought them these masks to wear and handout to their classmates on the last day of school. Since fear is still running the show with these schools, the kids have to wear masks. The flag masks are great, as comfortable as a mask allows, slightly breathable and allows the kids to properly express their 1st amendment rights."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",UglyNell,92,55,"I order these every few weeks when they run out in my house. We love them, nobody has complained about the texture, the strings or the size. Definitely should get you some."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",J. Will,2,21,Bought these on sale and its great. I have pretty sensitive skin and so far have not broke out (mask acne) wearing these. The loops don't hurt the back of my ears either. These don't tickle your nostril even after a long day wearing them. Will buy again.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Whitney,73,18,"I work in healthcare so sadly still wearing a mask all day. I ordered these looking for something more comfortable and breathable. These are wonderful! Ideally no mask on my face feels the best, but if your in healthcare still rocking the masks I highly recommend."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Dancewriter,662,371,"I stretched out the ear tabs on these things and they fit much better - they were too tight, but now they're just loose enough to be comfortable and hardly noticeable which is a feat for masking anyway."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",xJenx,5,9,"Great value and great quality. I did take the masks out of the resealable pouch for a day to air out the slight smell that all disposable masks have and they’ve been odorless since. Ear loops are comfortable and the masks fit great with the moldable nose wire. My friend was complaining about her own mask hurting her ears on an all day trip recently so I gave her one of these and several hours later, she said her ears felt great. I’d buy these again when I run out."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Aubrey Lynea Shore,42,45,These are so much nicer and more breathable than the cotton store bought masks that have become so popular. The all black is sleek and perfect for those jobs that require masks the entire time you’re working.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Jennifer Bland,15,26,These are amazing! I’ve purchased these multiple times to stock in my classroom for students and they love them. I will continue to reorder them every time I need to restock. Thank you for a great product!
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Pdxcableguy,17,44,"One of the most comfortable disposables I've tried. Feel confident in the triple layer and it is the more comfortable, softer paper mask. 3rd order."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Deborah Trumpold,192,236,Wow……these masks made a huge difference in my comfort while wearing a mask in public. Love the neutral grey color (nice balance between wearing a white or black mask).
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Leslie Couso,2,17,"Work in the medical field so am still mandated to wear mask. My job supplies the traditional blue disposable mask but love these black ones. Doesn’t make me sweaty, and last between taking it off putting it back on throughout the day."
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",AbC,26,15,You get what you pay for. Masks came packaged in plastic not in boxes as pictured. Not sure if that played role in funky smell the masks had. They run a bit smaller than other masks that I have purchased from other vendors in the past. First and last time ordering from this vendor.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Dee,30,71,These mask are definitely better than ones I order before. Nothing special and I highly doubt they are 3 layers but they work for the price.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Belle,4,22,Bought these to use for school everyday. The black matches everything and they are comfortable & very breathable.
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Gabriel & Jayson,3,14,"These masks are a GREAT value for the money, and doesn't take away from their comfort. I wear them for lomg shifts at work and when I am out running errands, and honestly, I prefer these over other masks I have ordered online. I definitely recommend them!"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Happy Mimi,0,10,Bought these to have on hand since pandemic seems to be an ongoing occurrence now.  My parents came for a visit and so I offered them half of the order. My Dad (tall guy with a BIG head) tried one on and it fit! No more discomfort from his ears being pulled forward by the masks provided in doctor's offices everywhere. Hurrah!
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",a,14,62,"After almost 2 years wearing a cloth mask, I got tired of washing them. Purchased 1 box of these disposable mask and I like them. Now they tell us to go out and buy N95. 🙄"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Kitty schmidt,9,26,"These cheetah print surgical masks are soo cute and comfortable to wear!!! I’ve gotten so many compliments!!

"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Ella,22,22,I’ve bought these masks like 4 times already and they’re really great. They’re pretty good quality. Comfortable to wear doesn’t feel rough on your skin. Doesn’t have that long lasting factory smell. Easy to breathe in also
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Katy G.,12,33,What I dislike are the Strings that's goes around your Ears Cuts into my Ears and cause extreme Pain. Totally dislikes the STRINGS TIES........
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",EAM,27,60,"Purchased for everyday use at school. Great quality masks, the loops don’t break like some masks that I’ve purchased before. No weird smell either"
"一次性口罩,100 片黑色口罩,3 层保护口罩",Laurence C.,73,32,Amazing mask that makes me feel safe yet still able to breathe. Also doesn’t pull on my ears. Having a big head most masks pull on my ears more.
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Charlotte A.,4692,4,"I didn't think this could be the solution I was looking for but I was willing to give it a shot. The other options were the neck sling, which looks totally effective but something about hanging my head by the door urks me...and a vertical table, which I've used and LOVE but its extra af (meaning I don't have space for that crazy contraption maybe when I'm 50). Most importantly, I needed something portable.  Man, am I happy this lil futuristic tsunami pillow exists (not it's real name, I give it nicknames cus it's just so cute and weird lookin!) I'll have to travel with it and have one in my life forever from here on out but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make...  What does it do for me/how do I use it? • it alleviates my neck, shoulder, and even lower back pain in a matter of 10-30 minutes. • At a minimum, I use it two times a week for 5-10 minutes (but usually longer if I have time) and just lay on the floor with it tucked under my neck and the base of it pressed into my shoulders. You take deep, thoughtful breaths and let your head drop back. As you breath you'll feel your neck making space for the tension to pass through and be relieved. Make sure you're not tensing your shoulders, you will and that's ok, just catch yourself and really let yourself continue to fall into the stretch. BREATHING THROUGH THE TENSION IS THE MEDICINE. This pillow guides your spinal chord into alignment. Also pay attention to your how even your hips/pelvis will need to realign as you lay there. • this alone permits me to go to town as a side sleeper. • being that I'm a side sleeper with double jointed shoulders that pop out of socket when I sleep, as well as a lower back disk herniation---for years, on the daily, I've woken up with the most intense aches in my scapula, neck, and lower back. Its worse on weekdays when I work on a laptop and tilt my neck in a dumb way, but this pillow completely eradicated that pain in about 3 days after purchase. So we can all agree, IM OBSESSED. • if I don't use it weekly, my pain will return as my work habits and phone habits seem to force me into terrible posture :/  If my experience sounds like yours in any way, I highly recommend you try this product! It will change your sleep, spine and body for the better."
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Lucinda Reed,1640,27,"Reviews complained that this product was too hard! Really people, do you even read the product description. This is not a pillow, it is a tool to help stretch and realign your neck. All you have to do is lay down, put this under your neck, and relax. Very pleased with the results too."
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Sheila Jordan,678,7,It really helped relax my neck muscles and alleviated the pain that I have had to deal with having cervical disc disease. This will be my go-to pillow every evening for 30 minutes before going to bed. I highly recommend this and also bought one for my brother who also has cervical disc problems too.

"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",A. Atta,1627,228,"I've had neck issues with a spur for a number of years. It got to the point if I raised my head a certain way, I'd get severe pain radiating to the upper part of my chest. Using this for a few weeks has made all the difference in the world. I just use it for 10 minutes a day and it repositions the curve of the neck to the correct alignment. Quality is excellent. It did have a slight smell when first opened, however, the smell has dissipated. So glad I found this product"
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Nicole DeCambra,307,6,"There are some products (not talking about the internet here, kids) that I would consider truly game changing. Weighted blankets. Running insoles. Good eye makeup remover.  This thing goes on the list.  I’ve had shoulder and neck pain ever since college rowing, when there were days I would wake up unable to move my head. A week or so ago, it got really bad again. It doesn’t help that I’m a side sleeper, have awful posture, sit at a desk more than ever, and tote around a two year old who is built like a tank. I went out for a run one day and was so sick from the pain that I was vomiting on the side of the trail. I could barely walk home, trying to keep my head from moving, and have had a debilitating headache ever since. I broke out the TENS unit, tried heat, meds, stretching. All of it.  When I went online to purchase replacement pads for the TENS, I found this cervical traction pillow. I have had more relief from a few days with this weird looking foam thing than anything else I’ve tried in the past 18 years.  It’s probably not for everyone. It’s uncomfortable at first, and you have to relax through the tension. But if you have neck pain, and anything I’ve said sounds like what you struggle with, this may be the magic you’re looking for.  (Thank you Amazon algorithm.)"
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Roadrunner,1095,19,"I am a physical therapist, looking for equipment to recommend for my clients with neck pain. This device is far too large for a female neck, even too large for many men."
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Brad4321,321,61,"I have a few spine issues and after a few years of physical therapy and weekly visits to a chiropractor, all has been resolved except for my neck. Disc C4 and C5 have partially fused limiting mobility. I also have stretched ligaments which no longer give proper support from a traumatic injury. Thus I have a mild, yet very annoying constant ache in my neck and upper back/shoulder area. This all is to give a background on my issues as each person will see a different benefit based on their medical problems. My chiro recommended I use his ""wedges"" at a cost nearly 10x this. I thought that was a bit ridiculous and here we are. While my chiro's wedge is a solid block vs this ""C"" shape, I determined that the curve this forces into the neck is very similar to his.  This works. Initial use is a bit painful and my chiro warned me of that. However, after about 5 minutes in the convex position (the ad shows what this is) it began to feel wonderful. I started with 10 minutes convex and 5 concave and will slowly work my way to longer times. 15 minutes of this made me feel 15 years younger and took away all my back and neck pain for a few hours and greatly reduced it the rest of the day. For me, I had to use this on a hard surface (floor) as my bed has too much give and reduced the affect greatly. I also used a lower back wedge (pillow rolled up) at the same time as my chiro recommends and I can feel that working as well.  This isn't a permanent fix, but for those of us with similar neck/upper spine issues, wedges can be a miracle. Wedges are really designed for those of us that do not have the proper curve in the spine for whatever reason, and if you do have the proper curve, you will likely not see any benefit (although decompression itself can feel great). This does cause discomfort on its first use, as my chiro warned me about, as you are moving things that likely haven't moved in that way in a long time. Pass through that phase for the most pain free day you have had in a long while!"

"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",THE LINDEN'S,652,117,"I work at a desk all day, and after getting Lyme disease my neck would constantly hurt from misalignment. After regularly going to a chiropractor for years he had to close his practice over a mandate.  When he closes I looked into ways to stretch my neck out and found this. I was skeptical. After not going to a chiro for 2-3 weeks I would usually be in too much pain to think, so I would go weekly.  Well it's been a few months now and this has helped me tremendously. I haven't had a misalignment since using it. I'll still get occasional soreness but it goes away in a day or two vs a week or two.  For me with chronic neck pain the difference is being able to stretch and re-align 3x a day and not having to wait 1-2 weeks. It's been a game changer!  The only thing to note is your family will give you looks until they get used to you using it. I choose the living room floor 🤣"
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Chloe,168,19,"I would say this is a product that is a hit or miss from what the comments and other reviews say. But upon getting the product I realized that many reviewers 1 didn't read that this is not for sleeping on and 2 didnt read the instructions online about how to use the product and what different ways you can position it to lay on it. Many say its too hard to lay on and other say no its prefect. I think all in all it comes down to the length of your neck. Im not a tall person 5' and rather short necked so laying on this with the sloped section under my neck was a little more uncomfortable that if I turn it the other way with the c curved part under my neck. Also try adjusting how far you place it under your neck as well. There's a decent sweet spot you have to find in your own neck for this product to work. Be weary of a bit of plasticy smell. I'm sure with time it will fade though. The product is a bit firm and the nodes do stick into your neck a bit but not too bad fro. What Iv'e experienced.  All in all i think this is a good product and for the price I'm not complaining at all. I have purchased this for my mother's birthday later this week because a long time ago she had a bad injury and fell on her head during gymnastics. It permentantly moved her neck in a place where she always wakes up with a horribly stiff and sore neck. I'm hopeing this product will give her good relief like many others have claimed it helped them. I shall update my over all review to 5 stars if it does work for her.  UPDATE: It works! She loves the shape of it! Perfect to stretch her neck. Also doesn't like the smell, it seems the plastic material has to off-gas and it just smells super funny. Hope it fades! But the product works great!"

Turns out I have military neck—meaning my neck is as straight as a steel pipe as opposed to naturally curved.  The pain is debilitating, which makes being a working mom a living nightmare. My doc gave me muscle relaxers and steroids, but they’re just temporary bandages for a long term problem.  I ordered this cervical doohickey to restore the curve in my neck. I literally received it this morning and have already used it for two 20 minute sessions. The crunchy crepitus noises coming from my neck were alarming, but my pain has resolved considerably. I never leave reviews, but I am so shocked that a few hours with this thing did more than a week of meds and a trip to a chiropractor, it warranted this long winded endorsement."

"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Skypaic,83,8," Went to an Amazon Re-turns store this afternoon. During my searching I came across what looked like a small maleable sculpture wrapped up in a heavy plastic wrapper. I couldn’t make out what it was but I’m a sucker for pads, back pads, etc. so I bought it along with 16 other items. At $3 each they weren’t that expensive. When I got home I unwrapped the blue pad and discovered a small white folder from the manufacturer. Rest Cloud C-shaped Cervical Traction Device. Wow. What a find. At 72 I have pain in my neck and shoulders every day. I routinely visit the mall and have one of the Chinese massage guys give me a 20 minute back massage. Well. I placed it on the floor and got down and tried to fit myself to the neck pad. It hurt to fit myself into it. Pain in my lower back. Pain in the neck. Slowly I moved my neck left and right and was able to get my vertebrae to match up with the pad. Twisting my hips left/right got my back into position and flat. Finally it felt comfortable. A while later I rolled to the right onto my knees and hands and stood up. Well that felt good. I walked into the kitchen and told my wife. Wow. That neck pad really works. She said “I left because you were snoring.” Snoring. I didn’t remember even sleeping for a few minutes. I felt good and I like this little cervical pillow. I bought a cervical device some years ago. It has a padded collar and a long cord that you have to connect to the middle hinge of a door. A lot of work and while it seemed to work it was a lot of trouble to set up. This Rest Cloud device easy to use and is permanently set. All you have to do is place it on the floor or solid surface. Get down and wiggle a little. You have to get yourself into position for this thing to work. I like it. I’ll be using it every afternoon. Sure didn’t mean to go to sleep while using it but it showed me that being confortable and in traction gives good results. I’m 72, quadruple bypass 15 years ago, diabetic and ornery. If it pleases me I’m sure you’re going to like it too."

The tension down my neck and shoulders and even into the middle of my back is terrible. I have been lying on this funny looking little thing for at least 10 minutes once or twice per day for the past several weeks and I truly believe it is helping me with overall pain relief. I know that it gives me relief from tension for a period of time immediately after I use it. It helps me fall asleep faster if I use it before sleep. The 10 minutes that I lay on it are wonderfully relaxing. I focus on my breath and feel the tension ease out of my neck, back and shoulders. I can't really explain how amazing it is. I love it and would recommend it for anyone with neck, shoulder or back pain related to tension. I call it the ""blue frog tongue"". LOL! that's what I think it looks like.

I use it 10-15 min every night and I can see many differences. I never think anything works and don’t stick with it. This is definitely making my dowagers hump much less visibly. I am also able to open my chest muscles. My vertigo is gone at this point which I always thought was related to my neck problem. I would definitely buy this again. Is not going to make the hump completely go away but it certainly looks a lot better and feels a lot better than it did.
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",racheldessa,437,35,"Honestly, I bought this particular traction device because of the one hilarious Q&A about this being made out of actual sea monster... but on a serious note, IT WORKS. I was in the process of moving, and ended up in the middle of an 8 car pile up on the interstate. Was I hurt? Not really. Was I sore? Absolutely. Did I have minor whiplash? YOU BET. After a couple of days of ice, advil, hot showers, and icy hot, my neck still hurt. I'm not as young and spry as I used to be. My chiropractor had very limited availability due to COVID. Finally, because I love not being in pain and actually getting some sleep, I hopped on Amazon to find some relief. I am extremely familiar with my body, and my body's needs. I knew that, for me, going to the doctor would result in a bunch of scans that would cost me money I don't have. I knew that I needed a cervical traction device.... and I am SO GRATEFUL that I purchased THIS ONE. The key to it is to breathe slowly and deeply while the weight of your head stretches your cervical collar out during the breaths. Even after recovering from the accident, I still use this for 5 minutes nightly before bed, and 5 minutes in the morning if I slept funny. I'm saving money by not going to my chiro, and it's lightweight enough to take with me when I travel. Well worth it!!  NOTE: I AM NOT A DOCTOR. IF YOU ARE INJURED, CALL 911, OR GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AS A FORMER EMT, I AM NOT TELLING YOU TO FORGO MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR THIS DEVICE. I'M SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS WORKED FOR ME, AND MY SITUATION. THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT."

The instructions it came with mention that you should put your hands above your head, resting on the ground (like a goal post). I didn’t see that in these online instructions or in the photos, but I did it that way anyway.  As soon as I laid back on it, I heard/felt several pops in my neck. And then that happened a couple more times while using it. Try to stay still while using it, and not turn or move your neck around. When I sat back up after 10 minutes, I had a strange/intense heat sensation in the back of my neck. It was not painful, but very strong, and I took that as a good sign. I am very curious what that meant if anyone knows! After that passed, I started to move my neck around and stretch it some and it was noticeably looser - I thought my head was going to roll right of my body compared to how tight it was before.  I look forward to continuing to use to see what kind of results I get after consistent use. Hoping this will help me get away from tolerating persistent neck pain and tight neck/shoulder muscle."

Results are as promised; Finally a product that does what is stated/promised! I am a petite woman (5’2”) and thought it might be too big for me... However, it isn’t—perhaps, b/c if the incline that supports the upper back & shoulders. It’s not like a cervical roll, which are always too big for me. This was the 1st time I used it, and was getting a migraine. A perfect scenario to test the product ...It passed with flying colors! OUTCOME: An aborted migraine headache, WITHOUT MEDS!!!! The muscles of my upper back & shoulders were relaxed quickly, and put me in obvious alignment. Once in alignment, I raised my arms above my head and rested them on the ground, then motioned like I was reaching for something while staying in the aligned position. basically, I was kind of mimicking when the Chiropractor gently pulls on arms to stretch out back. Doing this relieved most of my back discomfort I had, and extended all the way down to lumbar region. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT—5+ I doubt anyone would regret the purchase; It is well worth it!  BTW, it’s been 3 hours and my migraine has not returned! THANKFUL!! Best practical product I’ve ever purchased on Amazon! Thank you to the inventor/product developer!!!! Bravo! 🤗⭐️🏆🎯"

Instructions are nonexistent. I recommend rolling a towel up to get the same effect for the price of... well a towel which hopefully you already have laying around. Ripoff.
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Jessica Ballinger,38,2,"After reading through these reviews before I purchased this item, I noticed that a lot of people had talked about it being uncomfortable. I don’t think that people understand that the only way this will be comfortable is if your spine is already in perfect alignment, which I don’t think most people who are trying this are. It will be uncomfortable to move your spine into correct position. It shouldn’t be overbearing, but definitely some discomfort until you resolve the issue. I used it and could immediately feel a difference in my shoulders and neck. It was a good stretch and I could tell just how out of alignment I truly was because I was headachy and a little sore the next day. The more you GRADUALLY work with this, the less discomfort you will have when using it. It is not made for comfort, it is made for adjustment. I do think that it would be comfortable if I was in the correct placement for my spine though. I definitely recommend this product to anyone with tightness in the neck and shoulders, but you should definitely know what to expect when you start. It isn’t an over night it’s magically better kind of thing, it takes time to work things out, just like it took time for them to get that way."

"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Autonomous J.E.N.,1287,35,"I LOVE this product, but not for the advertised purpose which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. Trust me, it's better than the 1 I originally was going to give it.  I roll on a high-density foam roller daily for chronic shoulder knots and pain due to working from home 10+ hours a day at a mismatched and second-hand computer desk and chair. The foam roller happens to also crack me decently in the cervical and thoracic part of my back. My lumbar area, however, wasn't being taken care of with the foam roller because my spine had hardly any support as I would lean back against it, and it was uncomfortable in a bad way.  So I started searching Amazon, and Chirp looks great, but I'm not sold on having to buy all 3 products for full range of support for anywhere near $100, much less $119 where it's at now. So I buy a couple back stretchers and this thing for more than half the price of the Chirp.  When I placed this thing under my neck and let it hang, absolutely nothing happened. I felt zero relief for any type of discomfort. I thought it was a joke and I hardly bother with sending stuff back, but I was definitely going to send THIS back. I thought ""what a waste of money"" on this thing.  Then I started to press my neck harder against it trying to get some type of relief. I started to move it further down my back, and then I placed it at the base of my back. I began to lean back, but at that angle, I just kind of fell back to the ground, and my lower back immediately gave way and popped in sooooo mannnnyy amazing ways. A lot of great cussing ensued while I just laid there for a while. I FINALLY got the relief that my foam roller couldn't give me! It felt like so much built-up tension was finally released.  Before you send this back, try leaning back on this with it at the base of your back. You might find a favorite new back stretcher."

That said:  I’ve had horrible TMJ for the past 4 years after my wisdom teeth surgery. Jaw-locking, grinding sounds, pain, mild change in face shape, inability to open my mouth straight without training my muscles a lot of jaw gymnastics - I had all the works. The biggest pain for me was the inability to open my mouth properly, as the maneuvering it took to compensate definitely felt like it was making my TMJ worse and more painful.  I am happy to report that for the first time since the day I came home from surgery unable to open my mouth more than a few centimeters, I can finally open my jaw straight without having to slide it to one side first!!!! While I do still experience the popping sound while eating, it is definitely not invasive and not something that bothers me. I think it might be quieter now, but I will know for sure over time. I also still hear the grinding/pop-rock type sound in one joint occasionally, but not often. I have not had pain yet. I’ll start taking some head-on pictures to compare my jawline to older head-on images I have as I continue to try this out.  Hopefully in a few months I can say these effects are here to last. I am so thrilled to actually be able to open my mouth all the way again. I thought I would need surgery (I have a connective tissue disorder that makes issues like this more severe, so I found little success with exercises other than mild improvements). So this is HUGE for me.  I bought this for my primarily for neck as it has begun to ache occasionally over quarantine. I did not have any hope that it would help my TMJ, save for maybe a very tiny tiny sliver. I’ve never heard of something like this helping someone’s TMJ before, so I was very skeptical. I still can’t believe my jaw is one huge step closer to how it used to be. I’ve regretted getting my wisdom teeth out since the moment I realized I could never open my mouth normally again. I’ve never been more glad to be wrong.  My neck has also not been sore and has felt great, but that’s definitely been overshadowed as you can see. My jaw has plagued me much longer.  I know when I see raving reviews, I am sometimes skeptical that they might be paid for. Please know this is not paid. I just am really excited. I will certainly update this in a few months to see if this continues to be beneficial for me. As of now, I definitely recommend giving it a try. Amazon makes returns really easy, so testing it shouldn’t be too much of a pain :)"

My neck felt great the next day. I love the sensation of it stretching, it really helps. I bought a variety of tools for my own physical therapy and this is only one of them, but I do think it helps a lot considering it's the easiest product to use. It's also very comfortable.

Combine that with the new work from home //stare at a computer lifestyle and yeah- everything hurts.  came home after a long day- yay Amazon package! Unwrapped this thing and thought sure why not. Immediately layed on the ground and situated my neck properly. Did some deep breathing and focused on relaxing my muscles and suddenly it was like this tension I wasn’t even conscious of having in my entire head released. And then my heartbeat felt very nice and calm which it never does and I actually felt my pulse in my lower legs (I have terrible circulation it literally surprised me)  And then I fell asleep like so comfortable and not in pain (I have really bad insomnia and I was laying on the floor on a neck pillow, I was shocked???  Woke up about a half hour later more refreshed than I’ve felt in a while but also noticed my neck wasn’t making as many snap crackle pop type noises.  Long story short- this thing has been some kinda magic for me. I use it nightly. It’s addicting to lay on- I do it and just immediately feel … better. Just all around better.  It’s also helped speed up migraine recovery time, ease/stop panic attacks, cleared my sinuses/ helps with fully breathing so it’s also  Generally great for meditation as well.

A huge chunk of the neck pain I had been carrying around for the past several days was noticeable reduced. This morning I used it again before leaving for work. Again, was actually able to feel my muscles and tension relaxing. Actually leaving my body. I am sitting here at work now amazed and how significantly my pain has reduced. I would normally be struggling just to type - my right shoulder would be screaming at me already. But it feels doable today. I can't wait to get home and try it again this afternoon! This will not replace my regular chiropractic adjustments. But I do know that using this tool in addition to the regular adjustments will provide a tremendous amount of relief. This is amazing!"

I cannot believe how such a simple little thing provides such great relief. I also do other therapies to help with my neck (a prosleepy pillow, moving my monitor to eye level, physical therapy, a chiropractor, adding fish oil and Vitamin D to my regimen, etc.), but this is one of the most impactful therapies I've tried. For me, it didn't take much getting used to - it actually provided relief immediately. But don't ""sleep"" on it for more than 15 minutes, because that will end up kind of hurting your neck the next day. I do it every night 10 - 15 minutes right before I got to sleep, and then another session mid day if I need it. I absolutely recommend this really affordable solution to anyone who has ""straight neck"" / ""military neck"" syndrome..."

I've been told I will likely need surgery in the future to correct two compressed vertebrae in my neck. Surgery! YUCK!  I purchased this neck pillow on a whim because it was relatively inexpensive and I was desparate and in pain thinking ""what do I have to lose?"" It's not a panacea, but after three months of use I'm seeing the many benefits. I still get nerve pinch flareups, but I notice I am healing from them more quickly using this product. I also noticed improved range of motion in my shoulders after using it only once, and it's only gotten better from there! I follow the instructions that came with the product, making sure my knees are raised (I lean my knees together so I don't have to think about keeping them up), and my arms are raised next to my head. When I first got this my hands could not touch the floor without great effort, now three months later my wrists easily rest on the floor.  I'm grateful to other reviewers who gave guidance on breathing and relaxation. For once, gravity is my friend! I am now doing Yoga again after many years away, and noticing other improvements in my body. I also purchased the lower back pillow from this company (Restcloud) and it is helping, too!  I have a long way to go in halting (and maybe reversing?) the ill effects of life as a student then office worker, but honestly this pillow got me going and continues to help me. I even got my partner who works on computers doing it! This would make a great gift for anyone spending lots of time leaning over a workspace. It arrived intact and very quickly (I remember because I was hurting so badly lol!). I'm grateful this product was available to me at such a reasonable price, and I recommend it! If you are hurting I truly hope you find relief for your pain. For me, part of the answer has been drastically reducing screen time and typing, so I better wrap this up and go stretch!"

Physical therapy and NSAIDs have helped me deal with it. I recently changed positions in my company and my new work station is awful. I can’t afford PT or a chiropractor right now. I saw this on Amazon and thought I’d give it a try. My favorite thing in PT is when they cradle my head and gently pull. This duplicates that feeling! It feels a little awkward when you first try it, but stick with it. By the third day, it felt natural. And the relief! If I use this 5 minutes in the evening, I have ZERO pain in my neck and shoulders. Zero. It does exactly what it’s supposed to. I thought I was going to actually have to visit the chiropractor before I got this because I could feel where it was “stuck.” Gone. Pain relief, range of motion, and my mood are all great. Let’s face it, I’m a cranky old lady when my neck hurts. The only drawback is that one of my cats loves it, and I have to put it up or she’ll sleep with it. No kidding! She cuddles it like a baby, and hides it from me! Anyway, if you have chronic neck pain, or a job that makes you hunch your shoulders, BUY IT!"

I don't understand how a seller can go through the effort of creating a product, and then the text in the instructions is written in ungrammatical, hard-to-read English.

It's nothing short of a miracle for me. I thought I would never be out of head/neck/shoulder pain. I thought the dizziness from reverse cervical curve at C1 was it for me for life. I quit driving, I quit flying. I have been seeing docs for all these years, all sorts of docs, all sorts of fitness and diet, even surgery. This contraption did it. I love it.

I can not believe just how tight my Brest plate was. I was was expecting some improvements with my neck. But this is amazing. I'm a senior, so the 5 minutes to start, is a good thing.  Doing PT, stretching and pushing to limits of movements, just didn't work for me. I ended up buying a workout bench. So I didn't have to lay down on the yoga mat. Today, 7/17/21, I have full motion of my neck, with minimal pain at at the farthest rotation. I've been pretty religious with 10 minutes a day. It's such a relief, coming home from a bike ride, and not neck pain. So glad I took the recommendation from a U-Tube chiropractor."

This little tidal wave of a pillow is a godsend! I have instant pain relief after just 10 minutes of using it every day. I’m not even joking when I say I can’t wait to walk in the door plop onto the floor and prop this baby under my neck. I look forward to it tremendously because I know relief is coming!

I’ve had some serious knots in my shoulder area that are the result of falling asleep reading in bed at night, poor posture, and hunching over a device during the day. As a parent, reading in bed at night (when everyone is asleep and it’s quiet) is not something I am willing to give up. I tried massage, pain-relief creams/gels, and different sleeping pillows, to no avail. They provided some temporary relief, but every morning I woke up in pain. I started thinking that maybe my issue was more “bone-related” in its origins and that was what was causing the muscle tension. This was a last ditch effort before booking an appointment with a chiropractor. Holy buckets of glory, this thing has changed my life. Just 10 minutes a day with this (plus 10 minutes on my acupressure mat) has dissolved the muscle tension. I’m able to crack my neck and back consistently and there are no adhesions in my shoulders to be found. My massage therapist is astounded at the results. My hubby gave it a shot as well, and HE raves about it and about how much better he feels. We’re thinking about purchasing another one since we both tend to want to use it at the same time of day.

Too many purchases end up in the trash. Not this one. The relief I felt was immediate .. the first try. I used it for about 5 minutes the first time and soon graduated to 10 minutes on the concave side of the product. My range of motion has increased. The pain in my shoulders has decreased.

I originally found this on Instagram and thought that it looked like it may provide assistance with my chronic pain in my neck. I have an issue with a bulging disc as well as consistent build up of tension and knots in the area and surrounding areas. Chiropractic services are too pricy for me at this moment. I have one of those massage guns (which I love but it doesn’t do much for this area). The pillow, holds your head and in a very gentle way releases the weight of my fat head off my cervical spine and when I am using it the release of pressure feel so good that my head tingles and I feel like crying, in a good way. As a SPECIAL BONUS, one fact that I have not seen advertised is that if you push the pillow down an inch and raise your arms while using it, the sides of the pillow reach the knots in my upper shoulders! And if I rotate my arms the firm foam that this pillow is made of applies just the right amount of pressure to rub those knots. This provides even MORE relief and my legs tingle and it feels so amazing! Definitely worth every freaking penny bro."

Not only is it completely comfortable, it really works. It's sort of unbelievable. I've had multiple car accidents and neck injuries so my neck has compressed discs. I'm in daily, .chronic pain, and it gets very bad when I sit at a computer all day. Honestly I can't do the entire 10 minutes, but even a short session lying on this and the pain goes away, nearly completely. Enough that you can sleep...go about your day. Your pain will come back if you have real neck injuries, but this is the best thing I have ever come across and trust me I have tried every type of pillow, accupuncture, massage there is. Anyone with chronic neck pain should give this a try."

I was in a car accident 2 years ago and now suffer from migraines. I lost my therapy device stretcher thing I bought from the chiropractor. I decided to try this pillow instead. I was pleasantly surprised that it actually worked. I used it a week straight for 10 minutes each day. I can't remember when my last migraine was. Now I do get those random sinus headaches but not the migraines caused by my neck injury. I highly recommend this pillow. Put some soft music on and relax for 10 minutes.

Most reviews seemed to be written ten minutes after the consumer received it. It was as it they expected instant relief from pain, like a pill. Upon receiving it I read the instructions and did exactly what it said. I have used it daily for two months for ten minutes a day. At first my upper back was a little fatigued but I have kept it up and when used properly as a TOOL to change and correct the cervical alignment. Giving me more range of motion and allowing me to sit longer and stand straighter slowly correcting posture and strengthening back muscles by putting the spine in the correct position. I hope this helps other make their decision on this product."

The arms and shoulders have a more uncomfortable stretch from being in the wrong placement for too long. It’s a dull ache sensation that you get from any stretching helping bad posture but this gives you a deeper stretch. Just start with a couple minutes and work your way up.

And all those things do is raise your neck up off the floor and your hanging by a door knob or something lol 😂 This neck pillow allows you to lay safely & securely on your bed or on the floor and slip this pillow under your neck and get what seems like immediate relief!! I use this now once in the evening maybe an hour before bedtime and I sleep better with no neck pain or world tingling in my arms. I’m 55 and don’t have any major health issues and have not been diagnosed with spinal stenosis or anything else, but I was getting weird tingling in my arms and a sore neck every single night. It woke me up several times each night. The tingling has basically disappeared and I sleep much better and have so much more range of movement during the day when turning my neck!! So worth the money and I’d highly recommend this product to friends and family 🥰"

Just got my X-rays back from the imaging place and I have severe narrowing in multiple cervical vertebrae. Thought I'd try this while waiting to go to chiropractor to use decompression table. I figured if it didn't work, I could just return it using Amazon's awesome return policy. NOPE--this is NOT going back. I used it for five minutes as instructed and after just that short amount of time I feel such relief.  I really didn't expect much. Color me pleasantly suprised.  I have a shoulder/arm/hand injury I am waiting to get looked at, so could not fully extend my arms out like the instructions show, but doing the best I could also loosened up my upper back and shoulders. That's pretty good for just five minutes.  The neck stretcher is not too hard, but it's not super soft. I didn't find it painful though and I do have pain and a lot of stiffness and discomfort. My pain is chronic/ongoing from cervical degeneration. If you have an acute neck injury, you might want to ask your doctor if it's ok for you to try this device.  It won't fix my neck, I've got at least 3rd stage neck degeneration (chiro said that in 2014) but man, it's helping with the pain and maybe if I keep using it once or twice a day it will be beneficial. I will still do the decompression table at my local chiropractor (that's worth it too) because that's serious traction , but this is going to be my go-to at home treatment. I have several wedges and do-dads that I've purchased over the years and they either hurt or I didn't get immediate results and so didn't keep up with them.  I have tried different wedges and rolls and towels and such, but I think the extreme curve in this one and the way it tips your head and neck way back is why it provides so much relief.  I totally rec this. Will update at some point to say how the device helps long term. Try it. It even got rid of my neck related headache today and took away neck tension to the point I feel like I am more relaxed and ready to sleep well"

We all know doctors love to make money and they are basically doing a best guess approach anyways. Been using this product for about a week now and I have had some adjustment pains but this is realistic and expected quite honestly. When one wants true results they have to understand it’s not a cover up treatment like western medicine, your trying to correct the root problem. I will say it can be very relaxing laying on this thing, the different approaches do have different effects so you will have to find what works best for you. Given most people spend a lot of time looking at cellphones, computer screens and other devices that are poorly positioned for proper neck alignment I would suggest trying this product. It’s a gentle traction device in simply terms, that can offset some of our bad posture through our daily life. It sure beats the monthly massage costs I was paying before with far better results. Based on cost of product I would recommend giving it a try. Product quality is decent and not to much of a smell like other products.

I was sliding down a bit with the shirt and didn't realize what a difference that makes.

I have significant TMJ and regularly take muscle relaxants, have splint, take NSAID's, etc to keep the pain at bay. This arrived yesterday and I used it maybe three times for 5 minutes each time. Even going to bed everything was feeling a bit looser. Today I used it for 15 minutes while I was mediating and when I got up and opened my mouth it popped about 5 times without any pain. I have a much better range of motion both with my jaw as well as moving my neck and shoulder blades. Even eating hard foods feels much different in the best way possible. For the last year plus my jaw pops every single time I open my mouth and that has also significantly decreased. Will update in a few months but I'm very impressed!  UPDATE July 2022: Yeah, huge improvement in both my jaw pain/tension as well as neck mobility. When I am good at regularly using, my masseuse can tell because my upper body is far less tense and more mobile."

Forcep kids, and you know who you are, may consider this the best thing they've ever used. No guarantees, every condition is different, but wow, for this kid, a drastic improvement. My Chiropractor retired, I bought the thing due to a growing frustration with the symptoms caused by the ugly subluxations that continuously required a manual relief. All of the other ""neck curve"" equipment I found looked like stuff from the 19th century. This thing is molded from obviously new research. First usage, I heard a few ""ticks"" on the right side, and whoa! unrestricted movement. Not a one and done, this thing takes patience, and I definitely have slipped back a few times. Those of you suffering from the accompanying sacroiliac problems (with all of the lovely lower region symptoms that accompany that little item) will rejoice in this thing as I did. I sincerely hope that it works as well for you. I was a little desperate because my small town has no other chiropractors, so I just opened the box, read the quick instructions and threw caution to the wind. Even though I received a huge benefit right out of the gate, I would highly suggest that you take this in to see a chiropractor before use. That doctor will have to be one who is more concerned with his patient's health than losing some appointments."

Anyway, my goodness stretching my neck on this is amazing and has alleviated all pain and brought back my range of motion in days!

Initially, I had two spinal epidurals which alleviated the problem for about 5 years. Then in came back so I had an epidural again which did nothing. I was prescribed Gabapentin which I took for over a year. It really didnt help so I recently discontinued taking it. Then I saw this product and thought to give it a try. Even after using it for 10 min, the pins and needles in my fingers were significantly reduced. Ive been using it every day now for 10 min and more and more my symptoms have gone away. I would recommend using the Convex method (Gentle traction where the bumps are facing away from top of your head) initially, then gradually move to the Concave method, by flipping it around. I read some responses about it being too hard. Not sure what thats about. Its hard rubber, but not ""like rocks"" and it has to be firm to support your cervical realignment. Ive only been using it a short time now, so I will update my review if necessary, but for now, I couldnt be happier."

When I was younger I watched my grandfather suffer from intense neck pain all his life. The constant pain in my neck, getting worse over months, became so unbearable that I decided to research some of the causes and things that could be done to help. I was considering physical therapy, neck exercises, chiropractor, acupuncture and deep massage when I came across this. I was not very hopeful but after reading up on it and going through the reviews I decided to try it out first before deciding on those other options. I’m not sure how it’s made such a difference but I am very happy I decided to give it a try! The pain is not completely gone but is now not only manageable but very minimal. I also ordered a back brace with it to help improve my posture but tried it on for 5 minutes and decided I would just try to work on my posture without it since there was such an improvement already with this device. I’ve not been all that successful with correcting my posture, although I will think about it throughout the day and try. I use this device everyday for about 10 minutes and pretty much got instant results. I notice the difference if I’ve gone few days without using it. I move my head slowly 2 times side to side and back and forth while using it. Then repeat it a few more times before the time is up. The first time I used it hurt a little and was very uncomfortable. But as soon as my 10 minutes was up the pain was replaced with a tight feeling that cleared up within about 20 minutes. The second day was not uncomfortable, nor did I feel that tightness. I try not to miss a day or really try not to go more than a couple of days without it because I find that the pain starts building up after 3-4 days of not using it and it takes a couple of minutes to get use to it again when I do. I love this device!"

I was diagnosed with cervical osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis and four bulging disks around eight years ago. The head of Vanderbilt's spine and cervical department wanted to operate on me to remove the wings on some of my cervical vertebrae. I had no symptoms to speak of so I refused the surgery. I still have almost no symptoms but could tell the was a misalignment. I had what's called normal lordosis when I spoke to the surgeon as seen in my Cat Scan and MRI. Well, I approached the use of Restcloud with caution, 5 minutes a day, for the last 10 days. Some small muscle discomfort the first week. The realignment is great and no pain. Some reduced muscle stiffness. No more loud snapping when I rotate my neck that I had recorded on my cell phone. Great Product"

I've had sciatica for over 20 years and have been in moderate to high pain just about daily. Working from home and not going to the gym during the last 11 months has not made it any better. I tried it to be funny and show my husband how stupid this was, but I have found myself on the floor with the weird little thing every day, sometimes twice a day. It is uncomfortable at first, but once you relax and let your head fall back and breathe, you get used to it. I noticed that I was sleeping better, and my hands were not going numb during the night anymore. I am not as stiff when I wake up in the morning, and the knot in my bottom and tightness and pain in my leg is just about gone."

It relaxed and stretched my muscles so good my neck decided to let me know and it was worth every penny! It definitely feel uncomfortable the first couple of uses.

I also like to enjoy TikTok videos after a long day working. They make me happy. Regardless, I usually wait to review items for a little bit to get a legitimate and honest review, but two things: 1) I saw that amazon isn’t giving her the affiliation fees she’s supposed to get (which is sad) and 2) this product didn’t need me to wait several months! It’s that good. If I feel a headache coming in and go use this for a few minutes…Headache goes away. Sure, it takes a few sessions sometimes, but this really gets rid of some of the aches and is the closest thing to instant relief I’ve ever had. I love it. :)"
"颈部和肩部放松器,颈椎牵引装置,用于缓解 TMJ 疼痛和颈椎对齐,脊椎按摩枕颈拉伸器(蓝色)",Briana Smith,1,5,"I’ve had tics since I was a little girl. Not the ones that cause Lyme disease, the muscle spasm disorder. Which means I’ve been using my body in ways that are totally abnormal and cause major problems. It’s been 20 years now that my body has been attacking my muscles. I would thrash my neck forward so hard I would nearly pass out and still do sometimes under stress. Though it’s less now that I’ve had them for 20 years and have somewhat learned to control them the after affects have been awful. My doctors told me I could slip a disc so bad in my neck that I paralyze myself if I continue and that my body pain is that of an aged adult nearing their 60s. I’m 29. I’ve learned to control them as best as I can but I now have chronic back pain and ended up with military neck from it. I have so much pain from abusing my neck uncontrollably. It scares me sometimes. I have done acupuncture and chiro visits that always have helped but sometimes I can’t afford those and I feel helpless toward the constant pain. I don’t even want to imagine how I’ll feel at 40. I bought this as a last ditch effort to find relief from the stiffness and pain. I laid on it for 3 minutes and immediately felt scared my head would pop off. It was uncomfortable in the best kind of way. It was as though blood was flowing, muscles were stretching and bones were falling back into place. The exhaustion I felt after just 3 minutes was enough to have to roll off. I felt crunching so I took my time because again it felt weird to feel this relief.. I’ve now used it 2 more times today since trying it earlier because my neck keeps yelling “put me back on that thing!” I already feel like my posture is better and that I have a tool to combat my straight neck. I’m excited to continue and see how this helps in the long run.  If you have chronic pain, it’s $25 bucks. It’s a great self help tool- it might be a little uncomfortable but it’s because your neck isn’t used to it- just like mine. I just tell myself this is safe, I am ok, this is helping me and after I feel amazing- and it’s only my first day of using. Give it a go!"

I was very skeptical about the claims this product made and did due diligence in my research before ordering. Once a day I lay face up on a mat, knees drawn up, arms bent with hands next to my head. I do 3-5 minutes with the smooth side of the device under my neck (gentle stretch, heavenly), flip it over and do 3-5 minutes on the bumpy side (deeper stretch), then turn it back over to the smooth side for the final 3-5 minutes (ahhhhhhh). I’ve been using it for several weeks now and am very pleased with the results. My neck hump is gone, my back is straighter, my stomach muscles are tighter, my pain is almost nonexistent. It works for me. I hope it’ll work for you. That being said, I must add the warning that more is not better. I tried using it for a longer period but wound up doing more harm than good.

First off, start with 5 min NOT 10! If your neck bone is straight than this will make you super sore because you are going against the normal curve of your neck. You need to start slow and gradually go up over time. You will get muscle pain and maybe even a headache due to this trying to curve your neck and your body being out of line. Something like this needs time to help, but in the end will be so worth it! Pain is gain!!"

We tried a different brand before getting this one and we have not been disappointed by the Etekcity scale. When you step onto it the display lights up and gives you the weight and then turns off about ten seconds later. The day we received ours I had to go to the doctor so I weighed myself before leaving home and my weight was only .2 lbs different from the doctor's scale. I'd say that's pretty accurate! It does not save your weight from you previous weigh in but I actually prefer that. I can remember (or write it down) and it's just simpler to use without that feature to me. The scale itself is very nice to look at, sleek and modern. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase!

I thought 'hey, why wait to go to the doctor, why not just torment yourself now"".  I guess it's not the scale's fault. The scale with the app really expands on the whole 'here's what you weigh' notion.  To begin, the scale is inexpensive so I didn't expect much. When amazon dropped the thin box off I assumed it would be broken or crap. It was neither. It looks great.  It took seconds to add the batteries, download the app and get to humiliating myself. Let me say this about the app, there are a lot of products out there that have 'an app' and most of them are crap and look like a child designed them. This app is easy and packed full of information. The app seamlessly integrates with the 'health' app that Apple has to track everything.  I'd recommend this scale and app to anyone quite honestly. I can't blame the scale for the results. It's an amazing value for the money."

We put it in our bathroom and both my husband and I weighed ourselves. Then just a few moments ago, my husband went to weigh our son and afterwards scooted the scale back against the wall. The corner of the scale lightly bumped the bottom of the toilet then shattered into a million pieces! We were so shocked! I understand that tempered glass shatters this way (we own cups made of tempered glass that have shattered this way when dropped on a hard floor), but I don't think this particular light bump warranted such an explosion of glass. We owned the scale for barely a couple hours and each only stepped on it once. The large number of positive reviews for this item made me believe it would be a good idea to buy a scale made out of glass, but obviously it was not. Thankfully, Amazon customer service was very understanding and prompt at issuing a refund, but I would not recommend this scale to anyone."

I could step on and off four or five times in a row and get three or four different weights - and not just by a fraction but by a pound or more. This one is different! It weighs consistently every time. It came with little extra pads to level it, which seems like an indication that it is well made and so, likely to be more accurate. I like the look and it's a bit bigger than the chain store ones. And it did not cost any more than I've paid in those stores. Overall, I have to say this is the best scale, by far, that I've ever owned. I highly recommend it."

It actually got me to do something I've been halfheartedly trying to do for years, lose weight.

As a former fat person, I’ve been through many. Recently due to extra use, the pads on the feet of my scale started to come off. I was disappointed as that throws off the accuracy, however, I emailed Etekcity and they’re sending me new pads. Mind you, it’s been 2 YEARS, and they’re standing behind it to send me pads. They responded to my emails so fast, even on the weekend.  My favorite part of this scale is that you do not need to tap for it to hit 0.0 and then step on. You just get on and it does it’s thing. Those who have said they get a different reading in different spots, it’s more than likely due to uneven ground. Ive moved this scale all over my house and the only time the reading was wrong was when it was on uneven flooring(thanks old house!). I have stepped on the scale for a reading, then stepped off and took my shirt off or pants and stepped on and sure enough, the ounces go down. I’ve done the same with stepping back on after putting clothes on and watched the reading go up with accuracy.  This scale saw me through over half of my 130 pound weight loss! Many times I weighed myself and then went to the doctor the same day and had an identical reading there as well. That says a lot. Highly recommended scale."

"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Alexander R. Pruss,429,132,"Excellent scale, with very repeatable results. I did this test: weigh myself: 172.4 wash hands, then weigh myself again: 172.2 get 15 lb weight and weigh myself: 187.4 (=172.4+15) put away 15 lb weight and weigh myself: 172.4 There was thus a 0.2 lb wobble among the four test measurements. That's the scale increment, and so this is certainly acceptable.  You can calibrate the scale by tapping it with a foot while not being on it, but unlike our previous scale, you don't need to calibrate it each time you use it. This scale shows numbers instantly as you start to step on, and the numbers increase as you put your full weight on, and then it stabilizes at a final reading. It feels faster at getting a reading than our previous scale.  I also like the fact that there are no needless features to run down batteries: it just weighs, and that's all. There are no buttons on the top, which should make cleaning easier than our previous scale which had useless (for us) buttons for keeping track of different users' weights.  My only wish would that the corners were a bit more rounded."

There were a lot of complaints about inaccuracy but I have had no issues so far. Regarding it breaking, it is glass and obviously will break if you just throw it around and don’t handle it carefully (such as kicking it with your foot to move it or accidentally hitting it). Additionally, I don’t think a lot of people realize that this comes with warranty, all you have to do is register it (info comes with the package) and they will send you a new one or refund you, whichever you prefer. For the price, this is a quality scale. I don’t understand most of these negative reviews. This is a business, this is a mass produced product, there will be some bad batches, just make sure to use your resources (aka warranty). Might as well take the risk, it is not like you can’t return it or have a new one sent."

I set it up for myself on my phone and it sent all my data to apple health on my wife's phone. All i needed to do was use the scale. The app sent the data to my apple health and anyone that had permission to view my apple health data on their phone, had access. Perfect. I did not have to view my results or do anything except step on the scale. Just what someone with an eating disorder needs without having to pay a monthly fee. The problem arose when I tried to set it up for my granddaughter on her phone. There is no manual. No matter how many times I tried to set it up on her phone i ran into problems. I uninstalled, re installed, used the reset button and turned blue tooth and wifi off and on. If I get this resolved before I lose my temper and smash it, I will add to this review. As I said, this is perfect for what I want. All I have to do now is to get it to work for someone else as good as it worked for me. This is an update on 6/4/22. I solved my problems with the connection. My granddaughter needs to start the app before stepping on the scale. She does not have to see her weight or do anything else. I have no idea how long it takes for apple to get the info and for apple to transfer the info to me. It varies from 1 day to 3 0r 4 days. Sometimes I get 3 days together. A very few times, I have gotten the info the same day. I send the info off to her nutritionist who regulates her diet. The readout comes out with point 2 digits even though the scale only shows point 1 digit. My granddaughter is precise in measuring her food. Her weight seems to be exactly the same for 4 days in a row and then increase when her portions are increased. This tells me that the scale is very accurate. I am very pleased with this scale."

I bought this and took it out of the box and was pretty happy at first. a little on the heavy side but looks great. the sample batteries that were in it didn't work at all, so I was a little annoyed I had to replace them right out of the box. but once it had new batteries it worked just fine. it gives a read out very quickly, and seems to be pretty accurate (no getting on and off with a different read out every time).

And it's a remarkable piece of technology!  And I have a Samsung phone and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The VeSync app works with Samsung Health, so that was what cinched it, for me.  Recently, for some strange reason, when I stepped onto the scales, it did not turn on. I had just recharged the battery about a week prior, so I knew that wasn't the problem. Nonetheless, I figured that if I plugged it in, it would probably kick start it. Which it did. The next day, I had to repeat the process. On the third day, I used a paperclip to press the reset button, and that restarted it. And on the fourth day, I finally decided to contact VeSync and see what they could do to help me.  Their response came quickly, and their decision was to send me a firmware update. When I launched the app after their email, it was waiting for me in my app. Wow! Just for me, just to make sure that I got the latest update. I've never seen anything like that before, where a company actually preloaded my app, and had it there waiting for me!  I uploaded the firmware to the scales, and now it works every time!  Kudos to a company that understands that Customer SERVICE is equally important to quality products.  Thanx!"

They pretty much all work the same, except this one is light weight, looks nice, and shows you everything in the display, and with the Bluetooth integration, it’s seamless.

I highly recommend!"

This scale fluctuates a bit, from several ounces up to a pound or two. (especially after I “go”) . This tells me this scale is not only accurate, but it doesn’t save my previous weight. Therefore I never felt the need to reset it. I purchased this scale about a month ago, to help me be more conscientious of my weight. I’m working on shedding some pounds. So, I’m very satisfied with my purchase. I would purchase from this company again."

"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Nora,21,40,When my old scale broke I went right on Amazon to find a new one. This one was one of the best sellers and had so many reviews. However I have extreme buyers remorse and I was so nervous reading some of the bad reviews. I went back-and-forth about it for a couple days and then decided I might as well just get it because I can return it if needed. I am happy to say I love it and I am really shocked that anyone had bad experiences with it. Maybe user error? Maybe a fluke? But I am so happy with it. The price is awesome for what you get. The Bluetooth feature is so nice. It seems right to my phone when I step on it. I love that it shows not just my weight but so many other features that are important for my health. It was insanely easy to set up and it’s so light weight. I absolutely love it.

It was very important we keep an accurate weight record so I bought this scale because it was on sale and it looked like it should do the job. I wasn't expecting great quality at the sale price we paid but we needed something to weigh him and I figured we could just toss it when we left because it was under $20. To our surprise, it was better than our much more expensive scale we had at home!! We ended up taking it home and tossing the one we had! I highly recommend."

I also like the low profile that makes it easy to step on the scale. Even if you step on it several times in a row, the weight registers the same, which is not true for a lot of scales."
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",J. Grenader,147,34,"I have an Aria Fitbit scale that cost me quite a bit of money, and recently I've been noticing that it doesn't seem as accurate as it used to be, but you can't weigh a small amount like 1 lb to check it. I'm fairly small so even one pound extra for me is quite a lot (yeah yeah I know I shouldn't fret over one pound but I do, so :shrug:). I bought this scale because everyone in the comments said it was very accurate... and they weren't lying!  The first thing I did is weigh myself to compare with the Aria. This scale gave me the same number every single time, while the Aria varied from 0.7 to 1 lb more than the Etekcity scale. I then weighed a pound of butter on the Etekcity and it gave me EXACTLY 1 lb. I couldn't do the same with the Aria as it won't weigh small amounts, but weighing myself WITH the pound of butter just gave me the same 0.7 to 1 lb more than the Etekcity every time. I guess the Aria is consistent in its inaccurate weight?  Overall, I just trust the Etekcity more because you actually reset it every single time you weigh yourself. You have to apply pressure on then scale, step off, and then wait for it to go to zero, and THEN you weigh yourself. This means that it will always start from zero. With the Aria, you never know what you're gonna get.  I'm very happy with my purchase and I regret wasting so much money on the Aria. Yeah, it uploads my weight to the cloud and gives me stats and stuff, but honestly I NEVER look at it and it hasn't really brought me any value. It's probably a good tool for people trying to lose weight, but I'm just trying to keep mine stable so it doesn't matter. If you just want an accurate scale, the Etekcity is the best one imo."

These scales are calibrated per the description, and I believe they are accurate. The only ""negative"" thing I would say is that from the item picture I thought the scales were white in color. In fact they are clear. That obviously is no big deal. The picture must have been taken against a white background of some type."
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",A.

The high percentage of the 5 star reviewers convinced me, and they were right. I recently weighed in at the doctor's office, and was surprised that their scale was reading higher than the current one I have. Since the office uses a premium scale, it was obvious that mine was inconsistent. Sure enough, it was all over the map, depending on how I stood on it. This Etekcity scale, after I set it up properly, gave me the same reading as the one in the doctor's office. It's an attractive unit, easy to set up, easy to read, and highly accurate. Great purchase! Highly recommended."

"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",EM,85,70,I was skeptical about this at first because I had a similar one (but of a different brand) before and though the weight portion worked the analysis part stopped working a few weeks after I got it so I ended up getting rid of it. The reviews here and a family member that owns this scale are what convinced me to try it but honestly I was expecting the same outcome that I had with the other. I have to say I am actually really happy with this not only does the analysis give more detail than my other did but I can tell this will last because it's better material and the sensors were built into the scale better. If asked if I would recommend this by someone I would say yes.

Recently I started trying to get rid of some excess weight and needed to weigh myself weekly.  This scale looks just like my bathroom floor because it's clean glass. It's easy to zero and seems to be accurate.  I clean it off with window cleaner once a week. I leave it tucked under my pedestal sink and pull it out when I want to weigh myself. I just step lightly on the scale and step away. That turns on the scale, which then zeroes itself. Then, I step fully on the scale and it gives me my weight by blinking a few times then gives the weight. Then, a minute or so later the scale turns off until next time.  Easy and nice looking to boot!"

"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",TheDean,83,62,When you go to the box to write your review it has two questions. What do you like or dislike? What do you use this product for? To answer the first question I like it alot. This may seem weird but I only got it about an hour ago but it is an obvious quality product right from opening the box and seeing it for the first time. You can see that the tempered glass is thick and will hold up to the 400lb it says it's capable of weighing. It comes with batteries so you can start using it as soon as you open the box and place it on the floor. You'll have to pull out the tab to make the connection work but that's nothing to deal with. I like the display because it's big and I can see it well without any difficulty. It's larger than I expected. And it was a simple setup. You put it on the floor you put your foot on it real quick take your foot off it turns itself on and zeros out and you get on it and it weighs you. I got off of it and again made myself stepping on it and it came out to exactly the same number the second time so I believe that is at least accurate within itself. I think I answer the second question by telling you I'm going to be using it for my weight control. And speaking of weight control it also comes with a measurement tape also of excellent quality. I probably shouldn't mention that I have bought one other item from this company that I was so satisfied with their return and replacement policy. I bought these digital lanterns and one of them was defective which I wrote them about and they sent me another one without any questions. I had a question and asked him if I should send back the defective one and I said do not bother will just send you a new one to replace the defective one. So in closing I just believe that this is a quality company with quality products and a highly respectful return policy. They stand behind their product for good reason.

It seems to work just fine, it is light and maneuverable and I keep it leaning against my refrigerator just to make sure I don't overeat. But on an organic no oil , super low fat , high fruit and vegetable vegan diet , I can eat as much as I want and my weight varies only a few pounds after running marathons. So the scale is there just to audit, and I like the way it looks. Good price when I bought it, So far I'm very happy with it."
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Christina Haslett,42,61,I just got this scale 3 days ago but so far so good. The app was easy to set up. It even came with a little measuring tape which I didn’t realize but it was a nice bonus. The scale is very nice looking and small enough to easily store if you don’t have room to leave it out on the floor. My weight has been totally accurate. The app also has a feature to add a small child and subtracts your weight out to show you the smaller objects weight. I used it to weigh my dog.  Overall it does what it says it does and the quality was great for the price.
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Amazon Customer,4,10,"In the past, all I'd used were scales that seemed to fluctuate in accuracy, be broken easily, require special batteries, and overall were flimsy. This product differs from others I've used and is a fair price at that. Honestly, if I knew how nice a product it was, I would have still purchased it if the price were higher. This scale is easy to use, and I like the glass design. It reads better than past scales I've used, and the weight is read easily, which would make this a suitable scale for someone with poor vision. It does ""take up space"" since it is bigger and more difficult to prop up than a hard plastic scale, meaning you might need to set a space for it to lay flat in your bathroom. I did have a slight problem the second day I got it with the bottom metal ""risers"" which was easily resolved with a re-tightening/adjustment. Best scale I've owned, and affordable at that."
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Molly Elkwood,88,45,"Etekcity's customer service is beyond what one would expect -- I was too busy to contact the company to ask for a replacement and then went abroad for months, etc. and missed emails from Etekcity offering to replace the scale. The new one is accurate - if I get on the scale 5 times in 5 minutes it shows the same weight. BTW - This is the second time I am submitting an update. I don't know why the previous submission didn't go through"". OLD REVIEW: ""Wildly inaccurate"" I am disappointed. Depending on where I step on the scale I get varying numbers showing on the display -- the difference has been as much as 4lbs. Within a few minutes having stepped on the scale 5 times, and resetting the scale properly to zero in between the tries, the scale has not shown the same weight twice. I doesn't matter where I place my feet. It doesn't matter what floor surface I have tried it (wood and tile). For someone trying to lose weight a scale this inaccurate is really depressing. The two stars are for general appearance and the large digits and the clear display."
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",WildBill,5950,210,"I was really impressed, I was going to get a mechanical scale until I read the disappointing reviews on any that were not professional grade and price so I decided to give an electronic scale a shot. It comes with the 2 AAA batteries and a manual that is very easy to read. (not that you really need a manual)  I have a weight set with 200 pounds of weights so I loaded them on the scale and at 50, 75, 100, 150, 175, and 200 pounds and all were accurate, that is as heavy as I could test as it is all the weights I have, it is also more than I weigh so it was enough for my test. It also has a switch to change to that funky metric stuff if you like that system. Personally I don't want to be weighed in 1,000's of anything (Kg)...  So far I have been real happy with it, the scale lights up and is easy to read while standing on it, I do miss the wheel from my old one spinning but am very happy with result. I thought the glass surface would be an issue to keep clean but it does not seem to pick up foot prints from bare feet. It is also very easy to clean.  Am glad to rate it a 5, easy use, accurate, and comes with the batteries."
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Amazoncustomer,71,22,"I bought this about 4 years ago and it has been amazing. Super accurate, and I only had to change the battery once in the past 4 years with semi-regular use. To keep my scale working and in good condition, I make sure to NOT slide the scale with my foot - as a lot of people do. You can slide it too hard into a toilet or a tile wall and then probably break the glass of the scale resulting in a cut. It is super nice because of the sleek design, it looks modern and fits right into almost any bathroom design if you didn't want to store it away. I have lived in a couple places since I have bought it and it fits well in almost any decor. Its also super easy to clean because unlike some scales- it doesn't have little grips for the feet which are a nightmare to clean dust off of. I love this scale. And the tape measure is a bonus! Love it!"

Extremely easy to set up, has an app that connects my weigh-ins to my phone and tracks progress. You can do much more than I do within the app, but I am happy with the weigh in and tracking. Highly recommend! Also, you don't need to connect to the app if you want to just traditionally use the scale!"

With the free app it’s records all your weight by day and time etc. it also gives you a BMI, body fat, bone mass and several other body related readings. I personally look forward to my morning weigh ins. Plus it motivates me during the day to eat less and healthier cause you know the scale will let me know each morning how I’m progressing to reach my weight loss goal. Highly recommend!"

I was not in need of a scale that wanted to converse with my phone, tell the fridge to stop feeding me, the stove to stop cooking food and the microwave to not microwave anything either. Just a simple let me step on a scale and see how hangry I may stay that day. This scale is just that. Not fancy, no bells and whistles, does not rat me out to the other items in my home, nor does it judge me."

Our old early-digital scale just wasn't very accurate anymore, so we bought this one to measure our successes and failures in dieting. We're very happy with it. Compared to the scale at the doctor's office, it's right on target for each of us, down to the tenths of a pound. It's very easy to use...press down with one foot briefly for it to calibrate itself, then step on. The numbers are nice and large and a bright blue, so very easy to see. There's plenty of room for my size 7 and my husband's size 12 feet to fit on it without crowding the display at all. It's also very stable to stand on, as the flat little feet on it are close enough to the edges that the scale isn't tippy in any way. It's quite low to the ground.  We're happy with how it looks and how it functions. We're both losing weight, also, not that we can credit the scale with that, but it does help to be able to see even tenths of pounds in weight loss, to keep motivated with the diet. We're both down 30 pounds!  I would absolutely buy it again if I needed another one, and would most certainly recommend it to a friend."

The glass is durable, trust me, it's durable lol -- I have moved several times in the past year and a half and it has survived.

It's simple, looks clean and elegant, the digital display is easy to read for taller people who don't have the best eyesight and it's easily tuckawayable out of the way (if not out of sight) in the bathroom. The scale comes to a weight rather quickly and i do not doubt its accuracy (just recently verifying the weight it gave me at the doctor's the same day).  The only thing i don't like is that it's easily smudged -- i might not buy another clear scale like this again for that 1 reason.  I'd give it 4.5 stars because of the smudging, but since you should assume that buying a clear, glass scale like this, i'll give it an official 5 star review."
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Eric Lovgren,351,105,"The original scale I received didn't charge. Etekcity sent a replacement. The replacement also didn't charge. This would ordinarily be grounds for a 1-star review and some rather pointed words about the experience.  However... I have to give them credit... After I told Etekcity support that I had thrown away the replacement scale and I didn't want to try again (I also didn't ask for a refund or any other compensation for the experience) they volunteered to completely refund my Amazon order in the form of a gift card AND ALSO send me another scale, without requiring me to return the one I had pitched.  I've been a fan of Etekcity products for quite a while. The previous generation scale I owned worked well. Their smart devices work well, etc. This particular product didn't work for me. I ordered it the first day it was released, and maybe there was a bad initial batch. Or who knows... maybe I just don't know how to charge a scale.  In any case, if you like the scale's features, and especially if you use other Etekcity products, I would consider buying this scale. It will probably work. And if it doesn't, you can either return it via Amazon or work with Etekcity's customer service to resolve any issues.  I'm increasing my rating from 1 to 3 stars because, frankly, I'm not out anything for the experience and they bent over backwards to get a working scale into my hands and compensate me for the hassle."

This scale gives the same reading 3 times in a row, every time I weigh myself. It is easy to read. I need to push the scale out of the walking path whenever I use it, so I'm careful not to hit the tile wall due to reviews by others who report shattering. I'm extremely happy with this purchase!

"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",K. Stewart,28,19,"If you stand in a different position every time you get on the scale, your weight will change with your position. What I found difficult was to stand in the same position every time I stepped on the scale. If I changed positions a little bit my weight changed a little bit. I discovered this in a simple way. I stood up, head down to read the numbers with my feet on the dots on the scale. Then I stepped on the same way only with my feet between the dots on the scale. My weight changed by .2. Oh and for people like me who store their scale upright, if you do that you will have to calibrate it every time you step on it. To step on it and get your weight right away it has to be stored flat."

I previously used one made by bowflex but the weight range never really stabilized and by slightly moving my upper body I could change it within five or 6 pounds. At the price of this I was not really expecting much, but have been pleasantly surprised at how stable, consistent and accurate it is. My feet are a size 13 but fit comfortably on the scale.

"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",David,66,154,I've had this scale for what feels like a year and have yet to change the batteries. It sometimes reads inaccurate by 5 to 10 pounds on an uneven floor or whatever the cause but usually very accurate. BIG problem is turning it on. You have to tap one of the 4 corners or the very center with just enough weight to turn it on and sometimes the scale flips over physically.  Clear glass scale gets dirty easily. A rubbing alcohol wipe will do. Buy one 4 pack of AAA batteries and you'll go far. Comes with AAA batteries already and possibly a measurement rope for your waist I lost almost immediately.
"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Amazon Customer,12,6,"Ordered this scale 2 weeks after my son was born. When I first unboxed it in my kitchen it red that I was 156lb I was kinda surprised. Moved it to my bathroom and ever since it reads 165LB. I'm 100% not trying to lose weight and looking at the numbers don't bother me. I got lucky and my pregnancy weight was all my son. The roughly 20Lb I gained were gone instantly after birth. I'm the same weight I was before my pregnancy. I mostly got the scale to see how much weight I dropped after birth. Having the scale be 100% accurate wasn't a big deal to me beacus after you have a baby, the numbers are less important compared to how you look and feel. For me it dose the job but if you were on a diet overweight and trying to lose weight you might not like it.

This scale was extremely easy to set-up and the instructions were short and sweet. I love how it links to the app and records everything for you. I just started a new diet so this is perfect with my Fitbit as well. The accuracy seems to be on point so far. The first weigh-in scared me but the scale was just calibrating so the second time I hopped on it, the weight was accurate. I paid more for my last scale from Wal-Mart and that thing was never accurate. I highly recommend this one for the low price and many features!"

"Etekcity 数字体重浴室秤,大蓝色 LCD 背光显示屏,高精度测量,6 毫米钢化玻璃,400 磅",Johnny Train,236,192,"Product works as hoped.  Pros: Attractive glass/metal design. Appears fairly accurate and consistent. Accuracy readout to the 1/10th pound is sufficient. Easy to operate. Comes with battery. Stable on a flat hard surface  Cons: Black numbers on blue background a bit difficult to see. Lightweight unit that can easily be moved on floor by accidental bump. Not really a ""con"" -- only does weight in pounds or kilograms and not other body metrics -- but this is OK for my personal use since weight is the only feature sought here.  All in all, a good product for the $21 price. Have used multiple times daily tracking edema issues while taking diuretics. Would recommend as a basic weight scale."

Within the reasonable limits of what is safe for this scale to handle, I have been using it to help me weigh packages. Even weighing a 14.2 lb package by itself, it was accurate. When weighing myself alone and with the package, the scale showed consistent measurement of weight, despite being loaded to 8x the package weight. I have never had a complaint or disagreement about package weight with UPS or USPS. Oh and if I use it to weigh myself, it reminds me that I am a glutton. So that, too, is accurate.

When it arrived, I was honestly pretty shocked at how heavy it felt was since I was expecting mostly cheap or plastic pieces. The glass is cold if you step on it with your bare feet but that’s just common sense. It’s extremely accurate and I’ve been able to go to the doctors office weighing down to the pound. I’ve been able to weigh both my kitties, one just under 5lbs and the other right at 15lbs. The only negative is trying to weigh around 5lb mark usually only works for a few seconds and then disappears vs heavier objects will gather the weight, flash and then lock in the weight so you can see it before stepping off. It came with the batteries (!!!!!!) and a handy measuring tape that retracts almost like measuring tapes do so you can see how big or small certain areas are. Great for tracking if you’re trying to lose or gain weight/fat."

The accuracy depends on the type of flooring the scale is on! A solid wood or tile floor yields a different and more accurate weight as opposed to a carpeted floor! I tried this out in 4 different places in my home and each time I was 8-10 lbs. lighter on the carpeted floors. Hmmmm… interesting!

The new scale does the only thing I need - it reads & reports my weight quickly, accurately, and clearly, then shuts down (without complaint or comment). It looks great too, very sleek and unobtrusive, which is nice since I keep it in the bedroom, not the bathroom. Love it!"

Because, frankly, after 40 years of daily measurements, I've learned that my weight tells me what I need to know. So, based on reviews, I bought this Etekcity minimalist scale. Right out of the box I liked it for it's clean design. But the real issue is accuracy. This scale agreed exactly with my doctor's scale, it gives the exact same weight with repeated measurements, and it can't be cajoled by leaning (believe me, I've tried both sides, front and back, and all four corners). In a nutshell, it does what a scale should do, in a very low profile, sleek, simple design."

Now I keep them side-by-side and strangely enough they always say pretty much the same thing when I step on them. So I figure they must both be accurate. And I really weigh that much. The interesting thing is how much my daily weight fluctuates from day to day, even from hour to hour within a day. But given that they always say the same thing, I have to trust them.

And it really work accurately. I checked it by stepping on and off several times and the results were exactly the same. I checked my weight and after that take a known weight in my hand. the new weight was correct. This is the third scale I buy from different producers. The other two I bought from stores and they were broken in a year or two. I hope this one will last much longer.

The scale comes with the battery already in place so all you have to do it take it out of the package and start using it. It doesn't have an on or off button so you don't have to bother with bending down to turn it on or off. It automatically turns on and lights up and you step on it. It was a blue light with black numbers that appear when you step on to provide you your weight. The light is pretty bright so you don't even need to turn on the light if you're using it at night. It has rubber things on the bottom so that it stays in place without damaging the floors. We have laminate so that's very important to us. Overall, it has been super useful and looks nice!"

Bodyfat percentage: This scale told me my bodyfat was 33.9%, or what we in the industry would describe as ""medically obese"". I own and regularly test my bodyfat with the Omron handheld bodyfat analyzer. Compared to the scale's 33.9% reading, I consistently test between 19-22%. Omron's analyzer is accurate to within +/- 3%, and I've also had Dexa scans, caliper readings, etc that give me the same range. For an (almost) 37 year old woman, my bodyfat is actually in the excellent range. I'd highly recommend the Omron handheld if this is a metric you want to measure accurately. I take it with a grain of salt, but if you're prone to discouragement or getting triggered by seeing a high number, this scale may do more harm than good. For me, it's about a 14% inaccuracy, which is too inaccurate for me to really use the information meaningfully.  Skeletal muscle: Predictably, it calculated this as being ""low"". Which makes sense, this would have some sort of inverse relationship to bodyfat percentage. I don't mean to brag, but I'm a 150 pound woman who can lift nearly 300 pounds. My muscles are doing just fine. It's been awhile since I've done a Dexa scan, but I want to say it was in the high 70's, low 80's. Again, in the ""excellent"" category. So, suuuuuuuper inaccurate.  BMR: Probably the most dangerous one to have wrong, as it will undercalibrate your dietary needs. (Also, PSA, BMR is NOT the number of calories you should eat to lose weight. This is far too little.) It pegged me at 1349. I lift very heavy 4x/week for 90 minues, I walk about 60 miles a day, and I work a very physical job. Most calculators put me at mid 1500s.  TL;DR This scale's non-weight readings were so inaccurate that they made me feel like crap, even though I'm a professional and know better. If you want a scale that weighs accurately and syncs with your health app, this is it. Just don't get hung up on the other metrics. There are better tools out there.  Stop making me feel lame, scale!"

Just to test it out, I would step on the scale 2 or 3 times and each time it would give me the same reading. My only annoyance is that it’s difficult to take a picture with your smart phone.

For example, today I stepped on and it was 163.8, got super excited and stepped on again and was 170.4, stepped on again and was 170.8.

Display is easy to read too. It is not slippery and footprints are not a problem. It is worth more than I paid for it. I did NOT get this for free or at a discount in exchange for my review; I don't buy products that do that.  Three Year Update: It is still going strong and it is still as accurate.

Came with a fabric tape measure with a cool locking and retractable feature to get accurate measurements even in places you can't see before you move the tape. Unexpected and a pleasant surprise. My favorite thing about this scale is that you can see right through it to the floor beneath so it's very low profile - most people won't even notice it so it's not a glaring feature in my bathroom. Digital readout stabilizes and stays visible for several moments after you step off the scale so that you aren't fluctuating while you lean forward to read it. So happy with this purchase!
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Karelia,2755,29,"I decided to post some data about this FRER sensitivity for those of you who are like me wonders how the test reflects the actual HCG concentrations. I made serial dilutions of human recombinant HCG (Novarel), that I had some leftovers of after my IVF cycle. The dilutions were made with lab pipets, so the concentration should be pretty precise, and in the appropriate buffer (sorry for the details, that was my husband's urine) to model the amount of HCG in the urine for the test. Here are results (see photos attached too).  At 5 mU/ml, which is below the threshold of 6 mU/ml ( the sensitivity, claimed by the brand), the test is very-very faint. However, I would consider it positive, because just husband's urine only gives no second line at all (I do not have photo for this, we did it some time ago with our first unsuccessful transfer, when I had chemical pregnancy). 5 mU/ml in your first morning urine is equal about 10-15 mU/ml in blood, so this is comparable to 5-4 days before your missed period. Also, compare the 5 mU/ml results with my actual results for 8 days post transfer of 6-day blastocyst (last picture), two days later at 10dpt I had blood beta-HCG level of 38.  At 20 mU/ml we can see clear positive results. This is HCG level that you will have at your first day of missed period, and equals to about 40-60 mU/ml of beta-HCG in blood.  And only at 100 mU/ml we see the second line at the same brightness as the control line. I would say at this HCG level the FRER test reaches it's saturation point.  Also, I found out that you may use LH tests (used for ovulation detection) instead of HCG for the early results. LH tests are very sensitive, looks like even more sensitive than FRER (you can see how much darker the test line is for the 5 mU/ml sample). I could not find an information about what subunit of LH these tests are detecting, my understanding it is beta-subunit of LH which is nearly identical in structure to beta-subunit of HCG. Beta-HCG, however, has about 30 additional amino acids, so home pregnancy tests designed to pick up beta-HCG only, while home ovulation tests will pick up both. After ovulation and during pregnancy LH levels are down, so in my opinion you can easily use you LH leftover test to monitor HCG levels, at least to see how it doubles, for example.  Another observation for FRER, these tests tend to get darker with time. If your HCG levels are expected to be below or around the threshold (like day 6 post IVF transfer or so), and the test line does not show up, I suggest you keep the test for another 24 h and you may see faint positive later.  For those users, who claim about ""false"" positive FRER results. As my experiments with my husband's urine proved, if you do not have HCG, the test will be clear negative - no test line at all, only control line. If you see faint positive, which lately with another test disappeared, or if your period came, that means you had so called chemical pregnancy. It might be devastating, I understand, we had a chemical with our first failed IVF cycle. But this is a drawback of using very sensitive test, so just be prepared.  To summarize my experiment: FRER is very sensitive, it shows faint positive even below claimed threshold, however good positive results are at about 20 mU/ml, or your first day of missed period. I give only 4 stars for these tests because of the idiotic curved handle - it is completely unnecessary design, makes it difficult to lay flat, and takes more space in the drawer if you want to keep the used test for future reference."
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Sarah Manning,316,11,"These are super super super sensitive tests. I was reading the reviews and struck by how some common questions are left unanswered.  -Why is the first line darker than the second line? Congrats, you’re SUPER pregnant. Your HCG is high enough to pick dye off of the control line. At this point, it’s unlikely that you have a chemical pregnancy. -Why did I have a line and then it went away? You most likely saw an indent or had a chemical. Chemical pregnancies are miscarriages before 5 weeks gestation. They are usually because of genetic reasons and nothing that can be helped. Indents are lines that look like grey lines. -How sensitive are these? I’ve tested as early as 8DPO and gotten a positive. My beta at 10DPO was 29 and I had a relatively dark line by then.  The main con of these is the price. Additionally, it’s easier to detect an early miscarriage and that may be emotionally too much for some."
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Aura,148,17,"I got my first positive test at 8 DPO (days past ovulation), which was 5 days before my period. As you can see from the picture, the line was darker on each consecutive day.  Every woman is different though. You'll only see a positive result once implantation happens for you, so if you get a negative at 8/9 DPO, maybe you haven't implanted yet or maybe you're not pregnant. You should just try again.  The reason I'm writing this review is because I think this product has been unfairly reviewed by women who tested too early and got false negative results. A couple of women also seemed to get ""false positives"" - although I'm sorry to say this is most likely the result of a chemical pregnancy, which I'm currently hoping is not going to be the case for me."

Not even a faint hope of a line. I skipped a day of testing because I felt pregnant and thought maybe I needed to give it some time. I bought a clear blue from the grocery store (because at this point I had used the 3 that came in the mail) now this could just be an unhappy coincidence but I don’t think so because it was positive immediately.

"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",K,707,38,"I don’t recommend driving yourself insane (trying to read faint lines too early). But if you insist on it, here’s what I wish I’d found when I was driving myself crazy!:  In this study (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16295647/), the FRERs detected levels as low as 6.3 mIU/mL. <5 mIU/mL is considered a negative blood test, just to clarify.  I did a natural (no meds) FET cycle with an hCG trigger (Ovidrel). I tested out the Ovidrel. Negative at 4dp5dt (4 days post 5 day transfer and 10 days post Ovidrel 250 mcg).  On day 5 after the transfer of a 5 day old non-expanded blast (5dp5dt or about 10dpo - that’s 10 days post ovulation), nothing appeared on the test with first morning urine between the recommended 3-10 min window read. HOWEVER, a few hours later (I know, I know) I thought I saw something. This is where I drove myself insane.  Can deposits from the urine settle on a test line after 10 minutes? Yeah, sure. I don’t really know, because I’m not a chemist nor expert in these tests. I’ve just taken hundreds of them 🤷‍♀️ I also still have all of my positive tests (and the negatives leading up to the days before the positive ones) from 10 years ago. None of them have changed (from negative to positive or the reverse, acquired a false line, nothing).  I dabble in photography as a side hobby and understand photo metadata (from learning PhotoShop) well enough to know that I am not manipulating negative tests to positive ones simply by editing pictures of my early tests. I am quite simply just using tools to visualize certain aspects of the existing data of the picture.  These test have a phenomenal ability at low-level reads! Albeit, visually difficult to the naked eye at these extremely low levels.  The best thing I can recommend (again, if you insist on making yourself crazy too early in the game) is to take a close look (and maybe even a picture-I did not) of the test BEFORE peeing on it. I did notice incredibly faint grayish test lines (but not on the control part) on my tests before I took them. And I struggled to visualize if my early faint positives were actually that gray line or pink (hence my use of photo editing tools).  As the days have gone on, so have my tests and the expected-slow increasing darkness of my test lines 🥰  Correlation is not causation, and I am not saying my photo editing of my 5dp5dt AM test proves accuracy. But I am one positive case. And for some, that’s just enough to keep the hope alive a day or two longer 💜"

I had convinced myself I was pregnant and was having an early miscarriage. I then tested with another brand and realize I was never pregnant at all.  These tests are torture for people TTC

"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Kristin,94,49,"I wanted to write a review. I use Amazon on a weekly basis for my business and personal needs. I don’t usually write reviews because I buy so many items. But when I saw many negative reviews about false positives, I had to leave one.  I have been using these tests ever since trying to get pregnant and they have been accurate. In October, I saw faint lines for about a week. They never got darker and digitalis finally began being iffy. Ended in a chemical pregnancy, definitely not the company’s fault! For those that are unaware, chemical pregnancies aren’t uncommon and happen between 25-30% of women. Normally it is due to an abnormal chromosome or low progesterone. Having a chemical is actually a positive sign that you CAN get pregnant.  Tried again the following month and all tests were negative, AF showed on the day she was supposed to.  Now we are in December. The pictures I’ve posted are my results for this time around. I started my first test at 11 DPO, then took the others at 14 DPO (day AF was suppose to arrive), 15 DPO, and 16 DPO. Lines got darker and at 15 and 16 DPO the lines are about the same color as the control line. I will stop testing now and be going to my doctors for blood work and hormone checks. Fingers crossed this is a sticky bean!  I will definitely buy FRER again in the future as I’ve never had issues, and all from Amazon, none were store bought."
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",AlexisH,11,27,"This product was a go-to for me this time around, as I used the same kind to find out I was pregnant 3 years ago. Disclosure, 3 years ago I tested AFTER my missed period and it was extremely accurate. This time again, I didn't use it for early detection, I used it the day after I missed my period. The unmistakable dark pink line showed up almost immediately, just like my last test 3 years ago. I had used one out of the same box a couple months ago, it was negative and I was definitely NOT pregnant, so that result was accurate just like my positive one. I dont think these tests are faulty. I can't attest to the early detection accuracy, but it has been right every time I have used this brand after my missed period. After reading the terrible reviews, I started to really think I had a false positive, but after a missed period the likelihood of a false positive is almost impossible. Please don't be discouraged by these negative reviews. I would recommend taking after a missed period, even though it says ""early detection "". If you are unsure, you should check with your family doctor before you make an appointment with your OB."

After using the 3 pack, I bought some of these tests on Amazon. I used one on day 10 and got a BLATANT negative. I was shattered, devastated, and shocked. I had gotten a positive the day before! I decided to go back to CVS and buy some of the same tests I used prior and also a digital test. Guess what? BIG FAT POSITIVES! The same day! Today I tested again with CVS brand and got another positive. It’s impossible that it could go from positive to negative to positive again. I read the reviews and realized I was scammed along with everyone else. BEWARE!!! Save yourself the stress"
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Ross Christensen,73,73,"Reviewing mostly so I can show the other obsessive testers what our FRERs looked like at each beta. I know how much I valued that information from others a week ago. We got our first FRER positive at 4.5 days past 5 day frozen embryo transfer. It was incredibly faint, but definitely there. These tests have to be super sensitive because I’m confident (based on our 11.5 dpt beta) that our 4.5 dpt number had to be incredibly low. I always took a Wondfo cheap test at the same time and they *generally* showed the same trend but they were often erratic and scary. Some days they showed more progression than the FRER and other days they showed less. The FRER line steadily darkened while the Wondfo line was barely visible until day 9 or 10, then bounced around a bit. Thankful for FRER! Best of luck and baby dust to all of you!"

We tried for about 2 years before finally getting our BFP and I got a ton of stark negatives which I appreciated as I didn’t get any false hope. Once I did conceive I got the most vibrant positive result and my period wasn’t even due yet. These tests also got lighter and lighter as I was having a chemical pregnancy. I knew as soon as the line faded that I was losing the baby. But, I appreciated that. Because I got a warning a week before I actively started miscarrying"
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Julia,12,13,"Overall seems like a basic pregnancy test. 3 came in a pack, my first one was negative (6 days before my missed period). I got my first positive 3 days BEFORE my missed period. And a darker line 4 days AFTER my missed period. So they do detect early but you'll get a faint line. Also don't recommend testing too early and getting disappointment over a negative test when it will be positive a few days later."

To all the kids out there who definitely don't want to fall pregnant, use protection, it's not that hard... honestly... Look here is a 100% honest review. I rely on first response and clear blue, both are well known and reliable brands. I have a suspicion that there are a few eager beavers out there who possibly test too early, hence the negative result! I mean c'mon a few days after ovulation...really? I tested 6, 5 and 4 days before my period is estimated to be due based on the app I use. All came out negative. I then used a clear blue digital test today, negative as well.... I won't lie I've had a dud digital clear blue... but that is more likely to happen over a first response test. They are accurate guys. Just but it!"

I was probably 4-6 days before my expected period when we found out our exciting news! I loved ordering these online because of the discrete nature. I hate the idea of running into my neighbor at the nearest drug store making an intimate purchase like this. It's nice to have these delivered to my home without any revealing packaging. Highly recommend."

I got a faint line at 9dpo. Gradually got darker as the days past and today 4.2.22, my period was due and I got a dye stealer. I have used these for every pregnancy I’ve had (3 total) and never had an issue.  As reviews have said, once, I too I was looking so hard while ttc I convinced myself there was a second line and there was, but it was clearly an evap line. That can happen, it’s heartbreaking but no product is perfect. I’ve stared at these test long enough to know and evap or faulty test when I see one. I always compare with a strip test or clear blue."
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",EnergyFlyGirl,240,39,I see a few reviews about the test giving false negatives but their reviews are kind of old. First response is a reputable company so I decided to go with it. It turned positive with no issues. This was confirmed by another brand and NOW by a blood test. I feel bad for the individuals who received false negatives and I am assuming they’ve pulled the defective ones because they worked fine for me just fine at 11 dpo.
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Ashlan H.,34,9,If you plan to wait until your missed period then you can buy any pregnancy test on the market. But if you want to know as soon as possible THIS is the test for you. We got a very obvious line at 9 days past ovulation. We took easy@home test same time and also received a positive but it was VERY faint. 2 days later this test was noticeably darker showing a clear progression of increase in HCG. The easy@home was barely darker. Overall it is very clear the first response is a TOP QUALITY pregnancy test. When you need to or simply want to know within first 8-10 days if you are pregnant do not rely on cheaper tests. Get the first response!
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",Kristen Long,32,35,"I know a lot of reviews mention inaccuracy being an issue, but these have been very accurate for 2 pregnancies. My first pregnancy, I took a test about 2 days after missing my period and it showed a very dark line/positive result. I took 2 more and again, got positive results and very dark lines and ended up with a healthy pregnancy.  With my second pregnancy, I had taken a different brand test 2 days after missing my period, showing a really faint positive. So I decided to try these again, and also got a faint positive. I ended up trying a bunch more of these and another brand of tests and continued to get a faint positive. Unfortunately, the pregnancy ended in miscarriage, which would explain the really faint lines, and that they continued to stay faint for 2 weeks.  All of that to say, the faint positives did make me question the viability and in a way prepared me for what eventually happened, since my first pregnancy I had such dark positive results, and in that aspect I appreciate the accuracy of these. Errors happen, but if there is detectable HCG, it will more than likely detect it. If you want more accurate/definite results, have a blood test done at the doctor."

I've been reading information about pregnancy tests for several years, and these tests were always recommended as being reliable and picking up pregnancy very early. I started testing 5 days after transfer, and there was an obvious second line the first time I tested.

I used two during my last cycle that were definite negatives when I was not pregnant.  I used the third (from the same box) during this cycle at 10 dpo and got a clear positive.

I had taken a pregnancy text with a cheaper test and got a positive, I then (a week later) took another just to be sure because I've had complications before with a missed miscarriage and it showed me a VERY faint second line. I was thinking my HCG levels were low, I was going to lose this one too, and just all sorts of depressed. I waited to take a pregnancy test the next morning same box, first response test to see if the line was more prominent. This time the line was even lighter!!!! Wtf. So I took a different brand different test at the same time and my results were dark red lines. I hate these tests for failing me so bad and making me go through panic. Don't buys these, read the reviews!!!"
"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",snestes,59,30,"I did my research to figure out what pregnancy test can detect HCG at the lowest levels and this is the number one product currently on the market according to several studies performed. I recently had a stillbirth so I have been antsy about finding out if we're pregnant again. It's been difficult but being able to rely on this test is great. I have used these test sticks in prior pregnancies and all were able to detect before my missed period. It does say on the instructions that the closer you are to your missed period, the more likely you'll get a definitive answer. Really, it depends on the individual woman and pregnancy and when/if implantation occurs and sometimes, it occurs just before a missed period so in that case, you can't blame the tests. I would give these tests 5 stars. I only wish they had more in a box for the people who might take longer to get pregnant so you're not buying multiple boxes."

Three days before my expected period and I got a faint positive. Difficult to see without a trained eye, but as a mom of 2 and a 4x surrogate, I have peed on plenty of these babies throughout my days and I know a positive when I see it! Only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I can’t confirm if it actually would have showed up 6 days before a missed period or not."

The two days prior I'd gotten VERY faint lines that could have just been ""evaporation lines"" on some cheapee tests and this decisively put the suspicion to rest. Even though it was still very early and I didn't use super-concentrated morning urine, the line I got with this test was obviously a positive even though it was substantially lighter pink than the control line. I'd definitely recommend these if the cheaper tests are giving you on-the-fence readings and/or you just really want to know."

It started getting super visible at 11 dpo and then at 14 dpo (day of expected period) the test line was the same as the control. Today is 16 dpo and the test line is beginning to steal the dye from the control! I think I'm safe to stop testing but these are a life saver for paranoid testers getting early BFPs!

"First Response 早期结果怀孕测试, 3 件装(包装和测试设计可能会有所不同)",sylvia,73,55,I had good results with this test and it showed up right away. I purchased these in June because I couldn't remember if I had my period. I used one in June and it came out negative then the next day actually I started my period. In earlier August I realized I had missed my period and took another test and it showed clearly positive. I took it probably about 5 days after I was supposed to get my period and it showed up 2 lines clearly pregnant. I am thankful for it because knowing early is wonderful and help me stop wondering. I made a doc appt soon after and yes it was confirmed I was pregnant. I had the strait stick one which I have used both (strait and curved) I really don't see any difference between the two to be honest. The only bad thing was out of the 3 test I had 1 did not work. The lines bleed together so I'm not sure what went wrong. It could have been from me using to much urine in them or the test itself. I do think the test worked great and would use them again in the future.

I'm still freaking out until I call my doctor tomorrow.  Edit: my Hcg was 27k when I got the very faint line. I read this is the hook effect - after a certain point it doesn't get darker.

She was not due for her period for another 3 days. The first test she took in the afternoon at work and it came back...""unreadable"" There was one pink line and it looked like another but we weren't sure. She waited until the day her period was due and took the test first thing in the morning. That one came back positive.

"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Jerica peters,7754,43,Loive this scale. Here is the comparison to the tanita (extremely expensive clinic scale) scale.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Vance Valerio,658,47,"I still can’t believe this scale was only $30! I’m a huge fan of the LoseIt! App and was looking for a Bluetooth scale that would make it quick and easy to track my progress each time without having to open the app and add my weight. Also BMI and body comp stats are something I was looking for in my next scale as well.  What really surprised me about this scale was how easy it was to setup. I’m used to having to go through various Bluetooth pairing processes but once I put the batteries in and created a profile In the RENPHO app it found the scale automatically.  Using the scale is easy when I want to record my weight I just open the RENPHO app and leave my phone on the sink, step on the scale and a few seconds later I’m done!  Because the RENPHO app can write data to Apple Health all my measurements are updated across my phone and LoseIt! can read my weight info!  I also love that the scale works without the app so my husband can weigh himself on it without messing up my measurements. It only records weights to the app when it’s open which is PERFECT for my household.  Great product, highly recommend!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Karanji,2751,26," I bought this scale and I bought the $60 Greater Goods scale to compare. Here’s what I found:  RENPHO SCALE: • PRO: With the Renpho scale, everything operates perfectly. The app is user friendly and visually appealing, easy to track your data, and no Bluetooth transfer problems. • CONS: The only downside to the Renpho is that is doesn’t visually display any other measurement besides your weight on the scale, but that info is collected in the app immediately so you can just open your app to see. Also the display screen is smaller and not bright like the Greater Goods scale.  GREATER GOODS SCALE: • PROS: The one thing I do love about the scale is that it shows you all your measurements (weight, body fat, muscle mass, etc.) right there on the scale as you’re looking at it. Also the screen is large and bright, very visually appealing. But what good is that if I can’t easily track that info later? • CONS: I love the look and feel of it, but the app is so terrible that it makes it almost not even worth using. I thought, “well maybe I just can track my data in the Fitbit app or in the Health app”, as the info collected from your weigh-ins can be transferred to other apps via the Weight Gurus app that comes with the scale. So far, I have not had any success with that data transferring.  LESSON LEARNED: More expensive does not always mean better! I will be returning my Greater Goods scale and keeping the Renpho! :)"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Kindle Customer,418,120,"Nice scale! It seems accurate, since it says the same weight over several tries and it’s great that it syncs easily to my Fitbit app! You will get all the data once you download the app, but only get the weight displayed on the actual scale. It will be good to get accurate weights to track my progress, and for just a little more cost than a regular scale. I keep it in the kitchen as a little added incentive when I go to the fridge...lol."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Ashley,1371,38,"Since I know how to properly calculate my BMI this doesn't really bug me a lot but to someone who doesn't this scale is inaccurate. So I'm a 5'6 woman, my healthy weight range based on height is 118-148. So on this app my BMI is standard, true. But in the weight area I'm in the ""High range"", with standard being from 106-129.6. 106 pounds would put my BMI at 17, a full point below the lowest normal of 18. For someone who was truly trying to lose weight, I would worry about them trying to attain an underweight BMI because the app says ""Oh this is standard!"" Besides that it's fine, I let it sync to my FitBit and use the information there as a more accurate guideline."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",leah,2140,6,This is the most motivating scale ever! It has this really cool feature that tells you when you are too fat.

It is glass, so I'm kinda scared that it will break... but I'm a big girl and it seems sturdy enough. ** I thought it was broken because I couldn't get it to turn on at first... you have to press on it with your foot to turn on, lift your foot so it reads 00.0, then step on it for 10 seconds to send the info to your phone. **"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",himsmj,303,4,"By first impression of the weighing scale is like just another piece of tampered glass top but then I installed the app and it took a whole new turn in terms of technological advancement. Things that blew my mind are as follows: 1. The app works realtime so you don’t have to look the the weighing scale display. 2. The app gives you option to create profiles, so me and my wife can record own weight trends separately now and the app is intelligent enough to understand which is your weight vs other profile weight. 3. It gives a while lot of information rather than just your weight which is ur BMI, Body water, body fat and the awesome fact is it gives you a scale which is low vs high so you know where you stand based on the above metrics. 4. Auto integration with Apple Health app which also syncs from my Apple Watch which adds my heart rate and all those stuff. So right now I am feeling I am in a hospital with all those data in hand like weight, BMI, Body water, Body fat, skeletal muscle, Bone mass, Metabolic Age,etc without literally going to a hospital  Jokes apart but this is a weighing scale for future and I thank myself for buying such an advanced product.Extra thanks for the developers of the app which made it awesome by far"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",J Balmer,1015,2,"I don’t write many reviews but this scale impressed me! This $30 scale works so much better than the over $100 Fitbit scale! I had the Fitbit scale for a few years, it was difficult to set up, kept falling off WiFi, and eventually had an error and kept wearing out batteries. This RENPHO scale was beyond easy to set up, it’s fast and syncs perfectly with the app and Apple Health. Did I mention it’s consistent? Works every time, the Fitbit scale would constantly need resetting and if you stepped on the scale 3 times in a row, you’d get 3 different numbers.  In my option, scales don’t need their own WiFi connection, Bluetooth is easier to set up and faster to sync.  The only suggestion I have for improvement is the mobile app. It was a little clunky, could use a simpler and clearer user interface, but it’s fine once you get the hang of it."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Carlos Campos,733,7,The scale gives very innacurate readings. Just purchased the RENPHO scale and my weight reading was 10lbs lighter than in my old scale which seemed way off. I decided to put 20lbs of dumbells on the scale to see how accurate the RENPHO scale was and the reading came in at 16.4lbs confirming my suspicion. I moved the scale to try to recalibrate but had the same problem.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Mamabee98,616,20,"Honestly, I haven’t even tapped into all of the features this scale has because the main purpose for even having a scale, getting your body weight, doesn’t work! There can be up to a 10 lb difference from one step on to another. I have to move it several times to different spots on my ceramic tile bathroom floor to finally get what I think is probably a halfway accurate weight. And I know for certain that it’s not the floor or the spot on the floor because I can put it right back to where I first stepped on it and it’ll say 10 lbs heavier! Super super frustrating!! I wish I never wasted money on this piece of junk and unfortunately I have passed my return window."

TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY IN THAT REGARD. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it ... If i went by what this scale said i would be so discouraged i probably would have quit even trying to go to the gym anymore... but luckily I have had enough people blown away by the change I have made to know for absolute fact that this junk scale is full of it"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Amazon Customer,544,1,"I tried to trick the device into displaying different body compositions (putting down aluminum foil and wearing socks, having somebody lighter than me stand on the scale with weights strapped on to make up the difference, etc) but the app showed the exact same figures for each one. Since no tricks designed to defeat the scale actually tricked the scale, it would seem that the BIA features are either poor or faked to begin with. I guess it works fine as a bluetooth scale but the BIA is dubious at best."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",James,503,36,"I purchased this because I am BIG guy (over 350 lbs). I wanted a scale that I could trust to accurately measure my weight on a regular basis. I had a scale that went up to 370, but I wanted to ensure that my original scale worked. This one clocked in 16 pounds higher than the other scale. It scared me to death and prompted me to work even harder on my weight. However, my wife also stepped on the scale and was immediately upset. The number did not match our Weight Watcher's digital scale, nor did it match our Aria (FitBit) scale. Again, it is approximately 16 pounds over the actual weight.  I have double-checked the weight with my wife, my daughter, and the professional scale at the doctor's office. This thing is grossly inaccurate. I wanted to make sure that it simply wasn't me, but this scale does not register weight correctly. The only accurate thing is that it seems to reflect changes accurately, but what's the point if the starting number is wrong? I am greatly disappointed in the product and would strongly recommend against it."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Ladybutterfly,705,62,"Update: I originally gave this product a 4 star, today I placed the scale on my tile bathroom floor to use, as I have done for the past 7 months, and it shattered in a million pieces. Needless to say I am am not happy in the least. Now, I have to purchase another one, ugh.  I love this scale and it's ability to sync information with my smartphone. It's helpful to have information such as BMI, body water, etc., to track."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",M. Garcia,586,26,"The scale is off... I was looking for the most accurate scale, but this one is not it. I step on & it gives me one weight, step off the on again & it's a completely different within seconds. It's on really flat floor, so I'm not sure how it can change so drastically."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Shopaholic77,129,11,"I bought this weight scale 6-7 months back and it has worked pretty well since then. It came in a standard box with a starter battery pack, so it worked right out of the box. Although the starter battery pack doesn't last too long so you should change it in some time.  As you may see in the pictures it is a nice looking product and I like the glassy black finish. In the back you can pop in 3 AAA batteries to get it working. As far as you bluetooth it was pretty easy to connect and you can connect to the Renpho app to have your data synced. The Renpho app also connects to the Apple Health app so you can have all your health/fitness related data in one place.  My piece has been pretty sturdy so far and the weight measurements have been quite accurate. It comes out a lot of other data such as BMI calculations, lean body mass, body fat %age, skeletal mass etc. I can't vouch for the accuracy of these measurements but I usually feel it underestimates my body fat %age (but I could be wrong). I especially like the graphs and visuals it forms over time so you can estimate the trend of your health goals.  Overall at the price point it is a satisfactory buy (and there's not a whole lot more I expect from a bluetooth weight scale anyways)."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",James W. Lanning,410,20,"If you want a digital scale that enables you to track weight trends on an app and see progress, this will do exactly that. I am glad I did not pay a penny more, however. After several months of use, it is obvious that it's not tracking anything else accurately. Body Fat %, skeletal mass, H20, protein, all the other things rise and fall in exact proportions to your weight. This is a dead giveaway that it is not actually measuring these things; it's simply using simple formulas to calculate the results based on weight. If I am simultaneously building muscle and losing fat, body fat % trend should be moving much differently than weight trend, but it's always in rigid lock step. BUT, the thing tells me my weight so that's worth $27 to me. I will be doing much more research before I put any more money into better tech in this space."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Brianne Lovvorn,544,1,"I've had this scale since last August but I've had a lot of problems with it. I love that it can give all the different variables and I find it is pretty accurate with actual weight. However I've had to replace the batteries in it a million times, sometimes every couple weeks and it's weird because I can take the batteries out and then put new ones in them out the old ones back in and it works again. Sometimes I was doing this every few days. I was really excited about this scale and its definitely something I really wanted to work and that's why I put up with the frustration so long."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",krisgrody,131,9,Burned through batteries fast and then it made the batteries corrode and ruined the scale where it wont work anymore. Owned it less than a year before it stopped working.  Update from 2 stars to 5. This company has amazing customer service. They seen my bad review and messaged me immediately and they sent me out a replacement. They had a defective screw that rusts they have corrected. I got the replacement within 2 days. So worth buying and it really is a great scale from a company that has awesome customer service that makes it worth my time and money!
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",K. Carter,144,14,This will tell you lore then you ever wanted to know about your fat body. A great value for all the data it provides. The app is easy to use. You can also set up multiple users. I underwent a comprehensive body scan at my doctors and the numbers synced up. I have recommended this scale to many people. The scale will only tell you pounds but it will connect to the app if your phone is near to give you the other data.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Amazon Customer,255,5,"Very easy to use, plug and play really.  Only reason for giving it 4 points is that the body fat measure might be off. I saw my doctor a couple of days prior to receiving the scale and I was 24%BF on the doktoras scale and 28% on the RENPHO scale.  I am not to concerned as I am looking at the longer term trend but I would expect a better accuracy.  How do I find out if it is accurate or not?"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Marissa,1487,226,"I bought this scale because my old scale would show my weight +/- 10 lbs in the same day and give me 3 different weights in 2 minutes. This scale is much more accurate, and I love that it sinks to your phone and can analyze BMI. Occasionally, it will be a little off, but nothing like my last scale, and I think that's only happened once or twice."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Lad F.,702,10,"I purchased this scale to pair with my iPhone 7 to keep track of weight and other fitness data. The product arrived and I immediately recognized the quality of the packaging. Packaging was robust and protected the glass face of the scale. The scale itself has a glass face and stainless steel electrode pads. It will complement the décor of any bathroom.  I followed the instructions to install the 3 AAA batteries that were included with the scale. Install was easy. I downloaded the app from the iPhone App Store that was recommended by the manufacturer. Pairing the scale with my iPhone 7 was easy and happened quickly. I stepped on the scale with bare feet as the instructions stated. In about 5 seconds, my iPhone beeped and I had all the weight and fitness data that I could ever want. The app measures, tracks and charts weight, BMI, Body Fat, Water Content, Skeletal Muscle, Basal Metabolic Rate, Body Age, Bone Mass, Muscle Mass and Protein.  Data is also recorded within the iPhone Health app, which is nice. Overall I find this scale to be great. It is a quality item at a price that is very reasonable for the Bluetooth Scale. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about tracking fitness data."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Rose,929,1157,"Update: This scale is a scam. It is not actually reading anything and is actually just giving you false information through the app. Amazon replaced the original scale because I thought it was defective due to the app. I was trusting the weight reading though, which showed me 4.5 lb weight loss. I deleted the first device, removed its batteries and put them into the new one and suddenly the scale was right back to the exact weight I started at. So I put the batteries back into the old one, added the device back...and it no longer showed any weight loss. This scale is designed to show you gradual weight loss by tweaking the numbers. So I began testing both devices with my kids and I. I weighed my kids and I individually, removed batteries, deleted devices, re-added devices, reweighed ourselves, repeated the process, and every time it would give us different weights and numbers in the app after calibrating. So I called my dr and explained the situation. The dr said they would set their medical grade scale outside for me to do a body composition check to compare. Their thousand dollar scale showed me a different picture. Wow the Renpho is all a con. The dr said that the Renpho scale is a clever scam designed to trick consumers who are looking to get healthy or lose weight and it shows them exactly what they want to see by misleading them originally to make it appear as if they are working their way towards a healthier outcome, when really it is just slowly working towards where they actually are when they start. Original Review: According to this scale I have a severe water deficiency, only 20%, and 17% skeletal muscle, which combined might mean that I'm dying. I was alarmed at first, and began drinking more water and using some more weights, but still the percentage doesn't change. So either something is very very wrong with my health, or something is wrong with the scale. Seeing as how I have no symptoms and am in my 30s, I'm going to guess that there's something wrong with the scale."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Melissa,920,84,"The scale is great. I didn't want to spend a significant amount of money on a new scale so this was a great option. The best part about the scale is that it comes with a great app. Here are my thoughts on the scale:  1. Inexpensive. For the price, I can't imagine you can get a better scale on the market 2. Very accurate. I was weighed in the doctors office. This scale and the weight on the doctors office scale was exactly the same 3. Great and easy to use app. Tracks my weight and BMI measurements. This can be very handy if you are looking to lose weight 4. Very modern/good looking. As you can see in the photos, the scale is also very thin  Overall, this is a great and accurate scale. FIVE STARS!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Amazon Customer,144,37,"What a piece of junk. Looks and feels like a cheap scale. Tried to pair with app many times, following all troubleshooting tips and never worked. Of course, they want your email address, name, DOB and height/weight to sign up for the account before you can even see if the thing works. Even as a scale alone, it was wildly inaccurate. I weigh 122- the first measurement said 110??? And the subsequent between 124-125-changing as I stood on it. Needless to say, it’s going back."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Sandi Glenn,120,13,I purchased this scale as a replacement to my Aria. The day I received the scale I started my weight loss journey. I weighed myself every morning but some morning I would forget whether I had weighed or not do I would weigh again. I started noticing that the scale is not consistent with weights. I downloaded the app to track this. I found if you don’t have the app open at the time of weighing then it does not register in the app. I spoke to my husband about the inconsistency so he tried it for a week and some thing. Our weights vary by 1-3 lbs within minutes. It is too late to return this scale or I would. I am extremely disappointed in this scale.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Jessica,364,44,"I had Gastric Bypass 4 and a half months ago and I WISH I would have bought this scale sooner! I started off at 300lbs but I don’t know what all my stats were at the time. Now I’m down 87lbs and I just got this scale in today and I learned so much more about my body. Now I know where I need to further improve myself, on top of losing weight of course. I shared this in my WLS Facebook community and a dozen or more WLS patients bought it. Looove it *thumbs up*"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Ade O. Ogunmokun,221,112,"Hands down...this is the best scale I've ever own...it's tech savvy....it will show your body fat percentage, BMI, water weight percentage, etc... and underneath it has scales showing the healthy range and definitions under each heading! I downloaded the app...so, it works with your smart phone...you'll be able to access weighing dates/data, progress, etc....it's pretty accurate and sensitive....I'm the type that will weigh myself 3 times consecutively....looking for consistency....it's on point!!!!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Hannah Graham,56,17,"I LOVE THIS SCALE!  I was blown away at the accuracy for the price! The scale is extremely easy to use, very stylish, easy to see numbers and lightweight! I have just started keto, gluten free, and dairy free, so keeping track of my body fat and water weight is extremely important for me!  The app is easy to find. There aren't a lot of clear instructions on how to set it up, so I'll do that for you.  1. Put in batteries, then place the scale on a HARD surface (no carpet, its tempting cuz it'll make you skinnier, but don't, its a lie!) 2. Go to your phone, make sure your BLUETOOTH IS ON, you can do this in SETTINGS 3. Go to the PLAY STORE(ANDROID) OR APP STORE(IPHONE) and type in RENPHO, a green icon will pop up, download that 4. SIGN UP for an account and enter all your info 5. Then, step on your scale. If nothing pops up, SELECT THE + BUTTON and add the nearby scale (some crazy number and letters) 6. For me, I didn't have to add anything it automatically synced 7. Now, your good to go!  To check your weight you can just step on, to check all the additional info, have your app open and your phone nearby. I found this scale to be accurate and kind of fun! Definitely worth the money! REMEMBER, weight is just a number!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Amazon Customer,188,25,I’ll be returning. I wanted to like this thing. But huge weight variances (3 or 4 pound) every time you get on it within a couple minute time frame. I guess I’ll keep my cheap Taylor
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Stijn Cos,109,14,"The idea of this scale is really cool, but once again what do you expect for a few bucks. Went to a trainer for real body fat comp and BMI and was wildly different from this scale. I believe this scale takes nothing more then your weight and plugs it into an equation for the rest.  I would give it 4 stars if it was advertised and sold as a Bluetooth scale that tracks weight through your phone but unfortunately they are trying to sell you on something that doesn’t seem to work on this device."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",wannabe perfectionist 💬,27101,2491,"I enrolled in fitness kickboxing classes in April of this year for 2 months in order to force myself to get out of the house and do some cardio exercises, and it worked. I lost 10 lbs in just 2 months then I started working out and lifting weights at home afterwards and I lost another 10 lbs in 3 months.  It was a joy every morning to get up and stand on a bathroom scale to find out that my weight has been slowly going down. Inadvertently, my weight would go back up slightly during the weekend when I treated myself with heavy meals and skipped working out.  I wanted to keep track of my weight loss progress so at first, I was manually entering into my iPhone's Apple Health app every day but this became very tedious and sometimes I would get too lazy to enter them in, especially if I didn't have my iPhone with me.  After 2 months of manual input to my iPhone, I had it enough and was looking for a smart scale that can sync with my iPhone and that's when I found this wonderful scale.  First of all, this is a digital weight scale that is very good at what it's supposed to do, which is to measure your weight. I have a digital scale by Sharper Image and I noticed that it would sometimes display my body weight very differently when I measure myself twice back to back. This never happened with this RENPHO scale. I even tested by getting on the scale with and without a 10 lb dumb bell and it passed the accuracy test.  I also love the app that you can download for free for your smart phone. This scale will sync with the app via Bluetooth automatically the next time you open the app and if you are near by the scale. It's so dead simple that you don't even have to think about it. It will store and remember your weight and other data for many days, if not weeks, until you are ready to sync.  Although the scale only displays the body weight, it actually measures and calculates other helpful data such as BMI, Body Fat %, Fat-Free Body Weight, Body Water %, Skeletal Muscle %, Muscle Mass, Bone Mass, Protein %, BMR, and Metabolic Age.  I'm not sure how accurate these measurements are but the fact that the scale would provide these data only when you get on it with bare feet tells me it's doing something. According to the manufacturer, the scale has 4 electrodes on the surface (the 4 metal circles) and when your skin touches the scale, the micro electrical current will spread to your body and test the condition of the electric resistance. This electric resistance data along with your height, weight, age and gender is used to calculate the measurements.  Also, this scale can be used to measure and keep track for your entire family members. Once you add the new person to the app, it's smart enough to determine who was on the scale and it will sync the data accordingly.  Finally, this scale can be synced with Apple Health, Google Fit, and Fitbit apps. This is a nice feature since everyone these days have either iPhone or Android so all your health data can be in one place like Apple Heath, which can also sync with many other fitness devices and exercise apps.  My only complain about this scale, which is not a deal breaker, is the fact that the app currently does not show the measurement value or even a range when viewing the trend graph in Month or Year view. The values are displayed only in the Week view (see attached picture).  I'm hoping that they will provide an update to the app in near future to display at least the range in the Y-axis.  I highly recommend this scale without any reservation for those who are exercising and/or monitoring weight loss. Hope this helps!  ** UPDATED on January 24th, 2019 **  RENPHO clearly listens to their customers as they have updated their apps to include the measurement range on the Y-axis. Great job RENPHO! However, the current range is not that helpful. Yes, it is better than nothing/before but the range is too broad. For example, my Weekly trend's shows 158 MIN and 188 MAX but my actual weight does not go over 170 or below 165. Therefore, it would be more useful if the range for MIN/MAX on the Y-axis is closer or better yet, have a option for user to specify MIN and MAX range. Looking forward to more enhancement! Thanks!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Nathan Edwards,104,36,"I purchased this scale as a apart of my weight loss journey. I was so excited to receive this scale and have it connect to my phone to record my weight so I had a log. After about a month, it started giving me a different weight every time I stepped on it. Not just like a few ounces, like 5 pounds difference. Before you start asking the obvious questions, my scale is on my hardwood floor, the feet are/were clean and even and I’ve replaced the batteries. So I contacted customer service and they trouble shot with me and still nothing. I asked for a replacement or a refund. They offered me a replacement but are out of stock. That was a month ago. I have messaged since and now I can’t even get a response from the company.  Poor product and poor company."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Manny,138,23,So far I like the scale. It has only been a few days but it seems to be doing what I need to. The biggest issue for me was the sync over to Samsung health because I use a Gear S3 and I have found a way to do just that. It requires a little work and make sure things are set up with 2 other apps and it will only track the weight portion but it works none the less.  These are the steps I took to get it working with Samsung Health: Ok Short answer is no it does not sync directly but.... I have found a way for it to sync using two other Apps. First I created my Google Fit and linked that with the scale app. You go in to the settings of RNPHO and select Google Fit and turn that on. Once this is down you download an Application called Health Sync. If you have a Gear S2/S3 watch and you track your steps on it than you will want to Sync from Samsung to Google fit. I am only syncing Steps and weight. It will ask you to configure what you want to sync for these two items and for me I am set to receiving info about weight from Google Fit and sending info about steps to Google Fit. Also in the Google Fit app make sure to shut off Activity detection if you are using the Gear S2/S3 that way only Samsung Health is tracking your steps. I just purchased the scale and I got it working last night after trying numerous things and I weighed myself and it updated Samsung Health with no issues. :)  Again it is still in the early usage stage for me and if an app stops working I will have figure something out but the scale works as it should.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Beks,197,53,What is the point of a smart scale if I have to open an app to use it? I might as well enter my weight manually. So it syncs with Fitbit still requires more than just manually entering my weight. Also not happy it has been locked for review for a long time. How many people purchased due to 5 star review (like I did) because reviews like mine were not accepted. Directions specifically say to replace the batteries that came with it because they will leak and ruin scale.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Charles Stevenson,43,33,I started weight training about 6 months ago and use this scale as a way to track my progress. It's very accurate and tracks trends in the mobile app. I haven't ever had a single issue with the bluetooth function. The app is very intuitive. I use the built in sharing feature for posting screenshots to social media or my online coach. I highly recommend it.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Long Beach Native,1591,336,"First of all, the scale itself provides a very accurate weight. I compared it to my ""old"" digital scale, and they reflected *exactly* the same weight on multiple tries on each scale.  I had a body scan less than a week ago, a DXA scan that I have a high degree of confidence in. I connected my scale to the iPhone app today and here are the results compared side by side. They are all within 5%, *except* visceral fat/VAT rating:  MEASUREMENT RENPHO DXA_SCAN DIFFERENCE ------------------------------------------------------------------ Total body fat 23.6% 24.7% 4.7% Fat tissue lbs 44.8 lb 46.2 lb 3.1% Visceral fat rank 9 13 44% Lean tissue lbs 138.0 lb 138.0 lb 0.0% Metabolic rate 1793 cal 1713 cal 4.7% Bone mass 7.2 lb 7.4 lb 2.8%  All I can say is WOW! Great product! Crazy low price!  The scale provides ""visceral fat"" as a single digit, which I presume is the Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) ranking. A ranking of 9, indicated by the scale, would make me very happy because it's at the high end of ideal. However my body scan indicated a ranking of 13, which is into the high range. Since I'm about 20 lb overweight, and have non-alcoholic fatty liver, I'm confident that my body scan results are accurate. So don't rely on this scale to give you a reliable VAT ranking.  Incidentally, I repeated the RENPHO test a few times, and the results of each test were almost identical. So even if these numbers might not be 100% accurate (they are only estimates), they are very CONSISTENT and would serve as a good basis for tracking your progress if you are trying to lose weight or enhance your fitness level."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Mike,11,1,"Play Video  I just got this product after reading the other comments and I have to say it's pretty awesome.

If something changes, I'll update my review."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Diana de Avila,9999,1420,"New scale Take 2 -  My first Renpho scale lost a foot. I left a review based on this because I got less than 6 months out of it. I have since been using a new scale that the company sent to me. I downloaded the Renpho app and the second time around, that worked better too. I've been using this new scale for about 8 weeks now and it seems a bit more solid and the app is working and proving itself to be stable and accurate.  I was cautious about jumping into a review with a new scale - I needed to use it and ensure it was working properly and the foot wouldn't fall off. I'm happy with the scale and app integration (and with the Apple Health app too). It's working well and easily.  The display is lit with large and easy to read numbers. The device is attractive with a low profile and is stable (the problem I had with my first one is that it lost a foot - it became completely detached from the unit). Renpho reached out to me and acknowledged the defect and replaced it. The company stands behind their product and I am changing my review to a 5-star review because of:  - usability improvements with the application and easy bluetooth connectivity and integration with Apple Health - the seller's communication and offer to replace.  The scale is versatile and well below the price range for similar products out there. At $29, it is a bargain and the readings it is providing for me are right on par with the ones at my local health club where I recently got a total body analysis.  I can now confidently recommend this scale. If something goes wrong, you have a company that stands behind their product. That speaks volumes.  5 stars."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Dennis,17,35,"So there I was, half naked and afraid of what the scale was going to say since my old one left me befuddled and not quite sure. Slowly I placed my feet on the Renpho body fat scale, sleek and cold to the touch, it felt almost comfortingly professional like a doctors office scale but without the sarcastic meanness of weighing me much higher...I hoped. The red numbers popped up quickly and precisely, what were they? My eyes blurred with excitement at the fact I could see my feet and the numbers... my goodness could it be was I really truly that much smaller than I had started before this diet! I got off and quickly jumped back on the numbers once again popped up quickly with the same answer. I was!!! The excitement was too much I ran to my room grabbing my phone to take a picture, but as I did I remembered this scale was smart, it had an app that could tell me so much more about my new body! I quickly pulled out the instructions scanned the QR code and there it was the Renpho app, thank goodness for quick internet speeds it was on my phone in a jiff. Professionally I easily zoomed through the sign up and login pages because of how easy it was, making my excitement all that much better. And even easier was the Bluetooth linking to the scale. Quick I jumped on the scale and this time not only did I get numbers there was extra move my as it talked to my phone(I hope the conversation was nice) then there was all I needed to know about this new body. Weight, BMI,body fat %, it even broke down what percentage my body was muscle, skeletal and water. Amazed I zoomed down the page devouring the the information then it happened I saw the metabolic age... was I that old no I just had my birthday... how dare this thing insult me this way. I took it as a challenge I would age backwards to this scale and blow its microchip mind. So here we are three weeks later and I am still the same age and weight but still none the less happy with Reginald the Renpho scale. And he has taught me I could add multiple users so my whole family can track their health. So here we are happy with the purchase and getting healthier by the day."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",LApharm23,75,6,"WOW, what a bargain!! I just bought this scale when my Fitbit Aria scale’s fat percentage kept rising!!! I knew it must be wrong because I was losing weight, and it was! I LOVE this scale! It gives a consistent weight and fat (which was 6% lower than the Aria). And, it’s only $27.00!! I will say I’ve had my Aria for 4 years so knew it was acting wonky. This scale will sync weight and info to Fitbit and iPhone Heath apps as well! Syncs by Bluetooth and was sooo easy to set up. UPDATE - I've had this scale since the beginning of December. I've had the same issue another buyer had: ""After several months of use, it is obvious that it's not tracking anything else accurately. Body Fat %, skeletal mass, H20, protein, all the other things rise and fall in exact proportions to your weight. This is a dead giveaway that it is not actually measuring these things; it's simply using simple formulas to calculate the results based on weight. If I am simultaneously building muscle and losing fat, body fat % trend should be moving much differently than weight trend, but it's always in rigid lock step"". At first I was thrilled but as I've been tracking all the data on a spread sheet I see also that the the fat % is exactly the same. Fat percentage and other numbers are useless. I also agree with him that the weight is always accurate, no matter how many times you get off and on the scale. Very disappointed :("
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",MidwestGuy,54,27,"Syncs with Apple Health, Google Fit, and Fitbit APP, nice scale with tons of features and only cost a few bucks more than the dumb scales that only give your weight. Nice design, the display could be a bit brighter but no complaints here, a great scale!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Sean,301,85,"UPDATE: Amazing customer service. I initially had an issue with installing the app. However, it turned out the issue was my iPhone not having touch verification enabled for the App Store. Totally an error on my end, not on the RENPHO app or scale. When I contacted customer support, Alice gave me what is hands down the best customer support experience i have EVER experienced for any product. She helped me figure things out and was patient and beyond responsive. I told her I would update my review and also give other buyers a head's up that if you have an issue with the app not downloading, first check your app store settings if you use the iPhone.  So now that I got the app all set up, it's amazing. Scale is accurate. I checked it against my current scale and it's spot on. Any fluctuations mentioned by other people have not been an issue for me. I may not like the readout I get because I have quite a bit of fat to lose LOL, but the readings you get on your phone (fat percentage, BMI, metabolic age, etc.) are great. I also drink about 40 8-oz glasses of water a day so the hydration measurement is vital for me since my weight understandable fluctuates considerably with that level of water consumption.  As far as ease of use, it's 10/10. Super simple to set up. Batters slip in like a glove. Took about 2 minutes to get up and running. Including setting up profile on RENPHO app.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this.  I'm working on linking it with my Fitbit app as of now also and will update once I get that settled. I am going to be upgrading to the Fitbit Ionic in a week or so when it comes out, so I'll likely wait, however.  If anyone has any questions, feel free to post them under my review and I'll try to answer them as best I can."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",WM8C,750,136,"So far so good! Bought this scale on a whim after our long time digiital scale failed recently. The price was competitive with others with the same capabilities and I was looking for something with bluetooth capability for results. I have an iPhone 6.  I had read some of the reviews and I was concerned about getting it to read the right units but didn't have any problems with getting it set up. It actually arrived while I was at work so my wife had it on the bathroom floor and working when I got home. I needed it to read in lbs. I have read where some poeple had issues getting it to use the proper units in the app as well as setup. I had downloaded the app the day I made the purchase so it was already installed, setup with the units I wanted and my personal info.  When I used if for the first time, I opened the app, stepped on the scale just enough to wake it, made sure the app had found the scale, and then climbed on. Coincidentally I had just been at my Dr.s office that day so I was curious how close the scale would read to that previous reading and I found it was within 1 lb. of that reading. As I stood on the scale with bare feet, it took about 5 seconds for it to do the measurements and the phone dinged when it had received the data. I looked at the phone expectantly and it was reading in units of stones instead of lbs.! I checked the settings in the app and still said lbs. was chosen as the units so I selected it again anyway, closed and reopened the app, and now it read in lbs. Not sure why this was but it has been fine since. It also is synced with the Apple Health app and reporting fine. My only additional wish is that they would add the ability to sync with the My Fitness Pal app. So far very happy with the product but only a week so far."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",C. Ivey,442,92,"I got this scale today because I heard about, and bought, the companion electronic measuring tape that works on the same app. I have an Arboleaf scale and app that I really loved but it was not compatible with the app for the measuring tape. So, I did a head-to-head comparison. Pros for the Renphro include being very slightly more accurate than the Arboleaf and having about 5 more measurements that may/may not be useful on a long weight loss journey: percentage protein and fat free body weight, etc. They both have the usual readings. And for almost all of them it was a complete match/tie: BMI, Body Fat, Visceral Fat, Body Water and Bone Mass. The Arboleaf won over the Renphro on the indicators telling what was considdred high, low, etc. that I miss on the Renpho. If you just want a great scale then these two are well-matched, high quality and you won’t go wrong with either one of them. About the same price too. But if you also want to measure inches then this new Renphro electronic measuring tape is a handy tool. Once you get the hang of it you can pretty much measure yourself which is a super great thing in my book. The tape results via BT go on the same Renpho app on the weight page instantly. In my case I am opting for the Renpho for the twofer benefits as I have weight loss long road to go. And my son is getting a great Arboleaf scale for his own use. We both win! I will review the tape separately."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",RainierRandy,371,120,"I'm impressed with the metrics you can get on the app.  I got a DEXA scan (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) from BodySpec the same day that I took the scan on the scale, within half an hour of each other without eating or drinking.  I'm showing pictures of the scale scan vs. the DEXA scan. Let me go through the reported numbers on the scale vs. the DEXA below:  Scale DEXA  Weight 180.4 181.5 (wore a T-shirt for DEXA scan but not for scale) Body Fat 13.2% 19.9% Fat-Free Weight 156.6 145.4 Subcutaneous Fat 11.4% NA Visceral Fat 6 1.68 Muscle Mass 148.8 138.4 Bone Mass 7.8 7.0 Resting Metabolic 1904 1712  The scale reports 10 pounds more muscle mass than the DEXA scan, and body fat percentage is off by 6%.  The scale seems to be broken when it comes to visceral fat, because it always reports 6. According to the DEXA scan, my visceral fat is only 1.68, so I wouldn't trust that.  For the price of the scale, I think it is fine to use it for comparative purposes when it comes to body fat % and muscle mass weight. I don't think it does a good job of tracking visceral fat.  I can get a DEXA scan for $45, and I have to schedule it in advance. I plan to do those once a year.  This scale is cool with the app, it's nice to see the breakdown it provides, but I would take some of the metrics it provides with a grain of salt."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",SheShopsIPay,62,35,"I have been using this scale every day for the past month. In the beginning I had a bit of a learning curve. This is what I do and it works well.  1. Open the app 2. Briefly step on scale to turn on 3. Wait for Bluetooth symbol to appear on the scale 4. Step on the scale for weight and let it calculate all the other stuff.  I do this every morning and it takes like 15 seconds total.  I do it this way because my husband also uses the scale, however he is not under my account. He uses his own independent account. We have to do this because the scale has a feature that will hold information and sync automatically at a later time. Since we want our info separate we avoid using that feature by syncing immediately. The scale will only connect with one phone while the app is open."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",D. Adams,172,52,"I bought this scale based on the reviews, the price, and the Bluetooth features. I liked that it synced with Google Fit and Fitbit. However, from day 1 I had issues with Bluetooth. The scale would say it was connected, but would not send measurements to my phone. I frequently had to enter weights manually (which, by the way, is REALLY annoying because it defaults to 110 lbs and you have to swipe the bar like 20 times to get it to the right range). I removed the Bluetooth connection and reconnected, and it worked once and then not the next day. Also, sometimes the interface to connect shows the scale icon mostly off the screen and I can't click on it. At this point I ignore the app and load the weight manually into Google Fit.  More seriously, I'm not convinced the weight is accurate. This week it showed me at the exact same weight (to the 2/10th of a pound) for three days in a row. Then on the fourth day it showed me down 2.6 pounds. At this point I can't really trust it. I'd return it but I threw the boxes out with Christmas trash and it's not worth the hassle of finding and shipping a new box back to Amazon.  Edit: The Bluetooth has been more reliable lately. It may have just been a fluke. I have upgraded to 2 stars. Nevertheless the actual weight issues are still there and very concerning.  Second Edit: I started calibrating the scale each time I use it, since I do need to move it slightly away from the wall each time. The anomalies with weight continue to happen. It seems like if the weight is close to the previously recorded value it will just show you that weight. It probably has something to do with the way it auto-recognizes individual people. Nevertheless, when it shows me the exact same weight for a few days in a row and then suddenly jumps down by two pounds, it is not a very accurate scale. It would probably be fine for people who only weight themselves weekly and aren't interested in small weight variations. Seller contacted me with suggestions for testing the Bluetooth. It seems to work reliably now, so I have increased my score to three stars.  Final Edit: Scale continues to perform erratically. It will show the exact weight (to the 2/10ths of a pound, which seems to be the accuracy limit) for 3-4 days, and then suddenly show me 2 pounds lighter. Seller sent me a replacement unit (umprompted by me). I set it up on a flat floor next to my old unit. I calibrated both and stepped on each. My old unit showed 273.6. The new unit showed 275.0.  I maintain my rating of three stars. This scale would be fine for someone who is not tracking their weight very carefully -- if you just check once a week and want to know if you are up or down a few pounds, it's great. But if you are tracking day-to-day losses or gains, it is just not accurate enough."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Jimmie N,168,43,"What a find. An attractive bathroom weight scale that is Bluetooth enabled. And lovand behold not only does it give an accurate weight reading it also uses foot pad sensors to show body mass, bone mass, fat mass etc etc etc. I’d feel pretty confident it’s not totally accurate but it does give a decent approximation of what they should be at the weight displayed plus sorta push you to want to get the calipers etc to see actually what they are. ;) Came packaged with batteries and everything necessary to fire right up. Easy, comprehensive, error free start up. Download and put all your info into the So Fit app and use your Apple Fitbit or Google health apps for detailed information. I have to say, for 28.00 US, I figured it to be just a “gadget” when I purchased it. I was sorely mistaken. For the money I don’t think you’ll find a better product. Easy for any age group to set up, and handier than toilet paper in the woods for monitoring your vitals.  I’d highly recommend it."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",BARB,691,191,I had no idea the measurements a scale could possibly do until I purchased this. I'm quite impressed because I know exactly what I'm lacking and where my weight is coming from. It also helps to plan what to work on next if it's taking more water in or doing more exercise. My husband and I both use it but we make sure that one of us is logged out on our phone before the other uses it so it will log appropriately.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Productqueen,39,61,"***Update 10/18/20*** so I had a bad experience with the scale that was battery operated. After reaching out to Amazon's customer service 3 times, nothing happened. I finally reached out to the company itself and they were on top of it! They replied to me right away and sent me a new scale, this time not battery operated, instead it's rechargeable. I took some time to write this review because I wanted to see how long the charge last and how long it take to get fully charged again. It lasted almost 3 months and the charge was done in a couple of hours if that. No problems with the app syncing and its super helpful for my whole family. We have football player size boys (3) weighing from 230-340lbs and this scale has withstood their weight! ***Previous Review*** Great idea for a scale but HORRIBLE execution. I was hoping that maybe I just got a bad one from the batch and since my return time had already expired I was hoping the 1-year warranty would cover it, BUT if they ignore all attempts at rectifying it then I have nothing else to compare it to. So it's just a POS, that sits in the box waiting for the company or amazon customer service to reply back with an outcome better than ignoring! SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Jason,221,65,"I recently got this scale as I have been looking for a new bathroom scale that was able to connect to an app and track information, so I did a lot of research as to what would be the best scale to purchase and after all of my research I landed on this one and I'm super happy I did as this scale is amazing! The scale is very easy to set up and connect to the app, the screen is bright, clear and easy to read. The included instructions are very clear and easy to follow as is registering the product for the warranty. I really like the fact the App is able to track a lot of different areas and not just weight, it tracks Body Mass Index and multiple other areas as well as lets you put in a personal goal that you are looking to reach and keeps you up to date on progress. The features and overall sheer number of things this scale tracks and allows you to do for the cost is beyond a bargain. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great scale to track multiple areas or who has a new years goal of losing weight or bettering their body mass index as this scale will really help you meet or exceed your goals. You can't go wrong with picking one of these scales up and will not be disappointed if you do! Its a real no brainer in the end when you factor everything together, so if you aren't sure or our on the fence don't be as once you get it you will be happy and likely only reason you might be upset is due to the fact you waited to order it!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Jessica,15,15,"I was a bit skeptical at first. I had a Withings special (expensive) scale, but there was a flood in my bathroom, and the scale promptly died. It died hard. It was shocking how quickly it was utterly useless. I didn't want to spend that much money again, but I really wanted a quality scale. I took a chance on this scale, and I honestly couldn't be happier. It -is- super lightweight! I take it with me when I have to leave the house overnight. It registers VERY quickly, and I love that I can just step on, it loads everything to my phone, then I can put the scale up and review things as I walk away in the app. It gives so much information, and another surprising thing is that it matches pretty closely to this biometric scale I have to weigh in on at the doctor's office once a week.  Highlights: -This scale is inexpensive, but doesn't seem like it in person. -This scale is more accurate than a previously more expensive scale I had. -If I were to have this scale die in a flood, I wouldn't be heartbroken because I could just order replacement without too much hassle.  If you're on the fence, honestly, BUY IT. I don't usually review things, but I can 100% truthfully say that I love this scale, and it makes weighing myself fun, haha."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",WkB,123,71,"I love this scale. I downloaded the app and it synced up easily. I was able to link it to my fitbit, which in turn is linked it to myfitnesspal so I see the weight tracking in all 3 apps. Pretty awesome. Other than weight, most of the detail info is only available in the RENPHO App, but, that's ok with me. I took the scale in my backpack with me to a doctors appointment. You should have seen the look on the nurses face! I guess a lot of people don't do that. :) The weight measurement was within .2 pounds of what my doctors scale read. So, I trust the measurements. I have found that I get the best detail measurements when I use the scale with bare feet and rub the bottom of my feet with a damp washcloth before I step on the scale. I don't do this when I simply want to see my weight on the scale, but, if I want to look at BMI and the other detail measurements in the app, I find it works best that way."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Prince Charming,271,126,"This scale is nice, I like the app, there is a comparison option which makes it possible to compare weigh-ins from one day to another. You can compare similar times of day from one day in the week to another day in another week, or from one time in the day to a later time in the day, I find that useful. There are 2 screen views for comparisons, I haven’t quite mastered that yet, but I know if you compare 2 weigh-ins, you can get a side-by-side comparison or, a larger scrollable horizontal row view if comparing 3 or more weigh-ins. The 2 weigh-in side-by-side is small on my phone. Maybe a larger phone screen is not as bad. You can delete a weigh-in if you think it’s obviously a error, which may happen if you step on the scale momentarily and not completely. After a couple weigh-ins I understood the timing to step on it. It looks nice, not a kids scale, any goofing around will mess it up, sensors need to be kept clean with a microfiber cloth. It is showing great accuracy so far in 3 weeks. For example a measurement on a pre-workout day compared to a post-workout day with no cardio just heavy weight volume on large muscle groups, will indicate a slight muscle mass increase but weight is same. I did everything the same as far as time of day, empty stomach, etc. To me it indicates I processed a bunch of stored fat for energy and used protein for muscle replenishment. The day I do cardio will drop my metabolic age 1 year the following day, it’s great to know these changes are happening and when you hit the plateau, so you can push harder. Very useful."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Sarah Hamilton,1398,499,"I purchased this scale at a discount during Black Friday and it's awesome! I don't have a way to tell how accurate the data is beyond weight (which matches within .5 pound what the doctor's scale measured), but as someone who regularly works out and is trying to lose a few pounds and gain muscle I love all the information it provides even if it's not 100% accurate. The app works surprisingly well and is easy to navigate. The scale only displays weight on the scale's screen so you will need to download the app to view the other metrics such as BMI, muscle mass, body water %, and several others. The app includes a chart where you can toggle between metrics to see how you're trending, there's a section for tracking body measurements, and you can enable different sounds to play when you weigh yourself. I like that multiple people can use the scale with their own download of the app, as my husband has started using the scale too. Overall it's a great scale - just remember it is likely not as accurate as the methods a doctor would use, so don't rely on it for medical reasons that may need more accurate measurements."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Sohit,69,89,"Update on Review:  Seller is great and reached out to me to know what issue I am facing and Taylor approached me the replacement with the new one. The new one I got now shows me regular readings so the issue of irregular reading is gone.  As said this is a lightweight, solid glass surface and an app to track your family weights.  Overall it's a good buy and in budget  Older one: -- Its okay I am able to know my weight but seems it is very sensitive. I tried to use this in different parts of my house and everywhere I get a different reading. I am not sure product is defective or it needs a perfectly flat surface.  Even if I do not stand straight or my legs little ahead of back I get a different reading.  Although the app I am able to track weight for all members of my family, so that's the good point.  Product although is tough and glass also good."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",R3537L1F3,290,29,"Pros - Bluetooth enabled - Multi-user detection - Small form and great design - Lots of useful information  Cons - Poor app  Was weary at first with not knowing the brand and right in the title boasting ""FDA Approved"". Even expensive name brand scales aren't going around yelling they are FDA approved so I was already skeptical. After reading reviews and learning that the FDA does in fact approve scales (could not find an official list of the scales) I took a chance. Wow is this scale amazing. The level of information given is great. I wouldn't use this as oppose to a trained medical profesional's oppinion but this is good for trying to see what needs to be targeted for weight loss (or weight gain if you need it). The only real downside here is the app. Now the app is in by no means horrible, I have seen much much worse. It paired with the scale easily, allows you to change the app's UI colors, gives you detialed info or what was gathered from the scale, a share button that share's a very well put together chart you can save to your phone or post on social media. It even connects to other fitness apps like Google Fit and Fitbit. The app however doesn't update regularly. There's no way to force sync the information from the scale so it could be minutes or even hours before it connects and syncs to it. I'm not sure if this is a scale limitation but if not then this could be fixed via a software update, but being it's a smaller company it may not be high on their agenda.  I would seriously recommend this scale for people looking for an inexpensive smart scale."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Brit,55,24,Yes! I just got it today I opened it and downloaded the app. I used it right away! I love it!! I just emailed their customer service rep who emailed me yesterday about the product to let me know that the directions booklet had been updated and gave me a new electronic one. I just emailed them to ask a question and they got back to me within 15 min. Not only absolutely amazing software and technology but also amazing customer service and I've had the device for about 1 hour! ...yes!!! Definitely will be recommending this!! :)
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Erwin Hero,714,95,"This may be dollar-for-dollar the best investment I've ever made on Amazon and I'm not exaggerating.  It tracks everything--weight, body fat %, muscle mass, bone mass, fat free body weight, protein and water levels, visceral/subcuntaneous fat and more. Everything I do, the information aligns. You can't cheat yourself from digital data. It has single handedly activated beast mode and unlocked my potential achieving real weight loss and body sculpting results.  Why? Daily weigh in gets you motivated and excited. The fact that it tracks more than traditional weight allows you to hone in on your dietary and workout style. Everybody has a different body and different physical and mental capabilities. But there baseline data this machine collects is consistent and necessary. I was dieting all wrong prior to tracking.  This review will get lost in the shuffle but for anyone on the fence, I recommend it a thousand percent. If you're consistent with it, and have a true desire to change your lifestyle and your body, it'll be an incredible investment."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",عميغنفي,531,129,"I have owned this scale for a little over 2 years, it still works fantastic. I honestly researched the heck out of scales: it blows my mind how many scales give inaccurate readings. Like hello, that's the most important thing a scale can do, is tell you how much you weigh! I bought a different scale that was supposed to help fight human trafficking with my purchase, which is great except the scale gave me different readings each time. I bought a totally different scale, and same problem. This was scale #3, and I suppose third time's a charm (thanks for that awesome return policy by the way, amazon prime) this scale has even outlasted the battery that came with it. A battery change later, and this scale still works great. I've only used the app on android (so I can't speak for how it will work with apple, though it was made to) and I love the information I get, and the ease of use. For the price, what it can do, how accurate it is, and how long it has lasted me, I highly recommend this scale as the one to buy!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",shoppershann,18,19,"I placed a 15lb dumbbell on the scale and came up 15lbs exactly. I also compared to my other bathroom scale and matched up perfectly. You have to step on with bare feet, although that isn't an issue for me. I wasn't sure about the privacy if another user in the home used it. However, my boyfriend just set up his own account by connecting to bluetooth and our information isn't on the same profile at all. In other words, his information is not found on my app at all. They are completely separate. I would recommend this scale."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",R. Kuhne,32,18,"Great scale within 2 /10s of pounds, app offers weight, BMI, body fat, Sub fat, Visceral fat, Metabolic age. If you enter just a few things, your weight , height and i think age on the app. Dont have to set up a cloud account. Say no to that when setting up app and it will just store the info on your phone if you are concerned about privacy. This scale with this app is great for anyone truly wanting to lose weight and be encouraged as you do. Since the scale does not just do per one pound but fractional changes, you see small improvements which will encourage you. At the same time with all the other info on the app and trending , you will see your weight drop, your fat, your bmi and all the other stuff decrease . In my case my metabolic age decreased 3 years so far. Now i know this is not 100% accurate like a doctors office however, when you see all these things decrease it will motive and encourage you to keep on trying. All these numbers are in different colors also on the app. So Red is bad, yellow is better and green is best. So you will see numbers change to ultimately all are green which is best. For the price, with the free app its so much more than just a scale. For the average person wanting to both lose weight , loss fat and get encouraged this is a great help."

"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Peyton Worley,41,30,"This is so much more than a scale. It measures your hydration and protein levels, metabolic rate, bone density, and so much more. I never liked scales much because I always thought weight alone is not the ideal measurement to determine health - for example, if you are very fit and have a lot of muscle, you probably weigh more and have a higher BMI than is considered ""good"" but that's a false measurement because, in reality, you're very fit. This scale takes those false positives and negatives out of the equation by giving you an immediate, comprehensive overview of exactly how your body is doing. It's phenomenal. I gave one to my mother to use to monitor her bone density and she can actually see real-time how adding calcium rich foods like spinach to her diet created improvements over time, taking the guessing out. Likewise, I was trying to increase my protein and wanted to see if adding legumes would do the trick. It did and the scale allowed me to see that and monitor the progress. It's a wonderful piece of technology! The only downside for me is that it requires regular batteries. I wish it was rechargeable. It also appears somewhat delicate so I wouldn't leave it in a high traffic area or where a Roomba is running, for fear of chipping the edges. Other than that, though, I highly, highly recommend this product."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Katie Spinks,289,71,"I've had my scale for about a year and a half. I'm very happy with it. I've changed the batteries only once, and I use it a few times a week. The weight is pretty accurate. I even use it to weigh packages that are at least 5 or so lbs and it's pretty accurate (within .2lb) compared to postal scale. I love how the scale looks and it's lightweight and easy to clean. The app is nice because it can track your weight over time. As for the other functions of the scale such as body fat percentage... I mean the readings are questionable for accuracy. They very directly with weight fluctuations as other reviewers have said. If it is actually measuring anything through bioimpedience, it's also heavily based on calculations on the app side based on your height and weight, so the results are approximated anyway. I think overall the readings give a good baseline and for most people are accurate enough to give you an idea of your body composition. Try supplementing by taking measurements and doing military body fat composition measurements and comparing the results. If you're of an athletic build it probably will be less accurate. Overall, I say it's a great scale for the money, but I wouldn't rely on the body composition readings."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Cassie C.,93,37,"I found this scale while just looking for any scale and honestly could NOT be more impressed. This is around the typical price for a normal electronic scale (if not even a little bit cheaper than the previous one I owned from Walmart) and is one of the most incredibly accurate scales I have ever owned. The display is very easy to read and only lists your weight unless you connect it to the app, which connects to the electrodes in the bottom of the scale to give you a detailed breakdown of your body (including BMI, body fat, fat-free body weight, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, body water, skeletal muscle, protein, and my favorite - BMR). These have all been consistent with what I have gotten in doctor's offices. It also keeps track of trends in your weight fluctuations and provides excellent insight to your health. It connects with the Fitbit app as well which is wonderful and a minor convenience (of not having to put in your weight every single time on the Fitbit app manually). I would definitely recommend this scale if you're curious about it."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",William J. Stefens,65,65,"This is a very good, and dependable digital scale, with a great app for your mobile phone that not only provides weight measurements, but also , BMI, percent fat, free body weight, body water, bone bass, etc. And, you can have more than one person's measurements saved. These measurements are also able to be downloaded and saved as an excel spreadsheet., And, you can also sync the app with other apps such as Samsung health, and fitbit. The other great feature is that as it is a very slim design it fits under the gap in many typical doors, thus, unless their is a very small gap between the bottom of the door and your floor, the door can be opened and not bump against the scale. A great feature for small bathrooms. The only downside with syncing to other apps, as behind the scenes it reads in metric, and if you have your settings in english, it automatically converts and the conversion may result in an occasional slight difference from what is shown on your Renpho app (+/- 0.1lbs). Other than that, I highly recommend this scale. For a rather inexpensive scale (<50), it is definitely a great buy."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",metrocopper,4,30,"Bought this scale to replace my inconsistent WW scale. The old one would register different weights if you got off and one within minutes without doing anything. I set this one up in minutes and used it in the living room on my wood floors and got a weight. Moved it to the bathroom and recalibrated it, stepped on and VIOLA, same weight as before. (My apologies to anyone named Viola) I plan to take it when I go to the doctors office next visit to check how accurate his is. I always weigh less on his scales fully clothed compared to my old one. This scale looks really good too in my bathroom and is easy to read the red numbers. It sync to my android phone the first try and gave me more information than I know what to do with."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Raven,256,112,"UPDATE #2: After returning the scale, some months later I received an unexpected package from Renpho. They sent me another scale. This one, seemed completely identical. Except this one worked perfectly. It was WAY accurate (tested using items of varying weights and all were spot on with what they were supposed to be. Maybe the first scale I had was just defective. But this one works great. Super happy with it. The ONLY complaint I have, there doesn't seem to be a sync button in the app. Should definitely be able to slide the app down to refresh or at least tap the weight to refresh or something. Because occasionally when you open the app it doesn't auto-sync your last weigh-in, which is frustrating. I'd dock it 1/2-star for that, but since Amazon still doesn't let us use half-star increments, I'll leave it at a 5-star since it's a minor inconvenience (but one they REALLY do need to fix).  UPDATE: Okay, I've had the scale a bit longer and decided to compare it to 3 other scales, one of which is usually about 0.2 off of the scale at my doctor's office. This thing is just horribly inaccurate. 3 scales show the same loss daily, this scale one day shows a gain, the next shows losses, it's junk. I'll be returning it.  ORIGINAL: The app is usable but nothing special. Contrary to some people on here lying, the app does NOT sync to MyFitnessPal without possibly some hacks of linking multiple accounts together and having one update another to another and so on. The scale also seems iffy on when stepping onto it will start it or just have it sit til you try it 2 or 3 more times."

"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",REZ,69,69,"Sorry if the title seems generic, but I honestly meant it. This is an amazing scale.  My previous scale is a joke compared to this one. That always needed recalibration if you moved it a little.  Not this one. This one is solid and locks on to your weight very fast. Then a few more seconds to get the rest of your body measurements.  The app is amazing too. It syncs to your iPhone’s health app automatically.  Multiple users on different phones can all use this scale without any issues. Every user will have their own unit (lb/kg/etc) preference saved through the app. Just make sure to open the app first then take the measurement.  Each user can also take many guest user measurements, but those guest data won’t be synced to iPhones health app. Only the primary users data will.  Overall it was a great buy. I’ll update this review if anything goes wrong. But I doubt anything will."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Amazon Customer,6,12,I'm very happy with this purchase. The scale is very easy to read and accurate. The mobile app is easy to use and I like that it tracks your weight overtime and shows your progress. You don't necessarily need the app if you just want to look at your weight but the extra information is really great. It is very encouraging. You can also click on the metrics to give you a little more information on them and what they mean. I have recommended this scale to my friends and family.
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Dani,116,25,"First off, while I can’t attest to accuracy because I’ve never had my body composition read, I am in the ballpark of where I thought I would be at, based on my knowledge of health and ideal mass, which isn’t good tbh, lol funny not funny, but that’s part of the reason I bought this. I think it’s easy to dismiss abstract assumptions about our body fat and BMI when they aren’t on paper, which isn’t good for our health longterm. For reference, I’m an overweight 36 year old woman, but I’m very “solid,” because I work out daily. I “look” attractive and get compliments, etc. and so it’s easy to let it slide, and continue reaching for large portions and cheat meals, even though in the back of my mind I know I’m supposed to be smaller because I am not at my normal weight right now for various reasons. Meanwhile, I am getting problems associated with being overweight, like hormonal fluctuations and knee problems, and yet tell myself I’m fine. Having this scale is so motivating because I cannot only see the hard facts, tough as it is, “on paper,” by looking at my reading on the app, but I can also see where I fall at on the scale and have a baseline to measure my progress now. I am so impressed by the technology of this for the money. What an amazing tool to work toward better health or to make sure you’re on track. The scale required 3 batteries and a quick pair to my iPhone, which took less than a few minutes. Within 10 minutes of opening the package, I had a complete overview of where I’m at now and a goal to aim for that is incredibly motivating. I totally recommend!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",phillysdon04,124,59,"My wife found this smart scale on sale on Amazon and that's how I came across it. I've been looking for an affordable smart scale for a while but I haven't pulled the trigger and buy 1 because I'm not very health conscious as I should be at this moment. I like this smart scale of the following reasons:  1. It's affordable. 2. It syncs with the Apple Health app. 3. It has a Apple Watch app. 4. It supports multiple users. 5. It looks good.  Cons:  1. I haven't heard of this brand, so I don't how safe my data is. 2. There's no MFA. 3. I don't how accurate the other dates is besides the weight. 4. I love that it supports multiple users but I don't like how it's implemented. So far I don't see a way to make your info private if you wanted to.  I'll revisit this review after some time and post an update if anything changes. Hopefully this scale helps me to be more health conscious since I have all this data. I'll definitely recommend this if you're on a budget."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Phil B.,93,35,"After having used this scale for the past 3 months, I have to say that I am quite pleased with how well it records results and communicates with the app. Me and my wife use it regularly while the kids use it occasionally. Aside from weight, it measures several other factors as well, such as BMI, Body Fat, Body Water, Muscle Mass, Bone Mass and a host of others. It even measures Metabolic Age. They do state that this is merely to be used as a measuring point and not as a basis for medical treatment so my review is being done on that basis. The app tracks it whenever you use it so I have a record of every measurement it's taken since I started using it. Using it is simple - just turn on the app on your phone, step on the scale, wait for the prompt from the phone, and you're done. My biggest negative is that you have to weigh yourself without socks because the scale's sensors need contact with your skin. I live in a cold place and the scale surface is glass (but very tough, I'm over 200 lbs) while the sensors are metal, so the feeling isn't ideal. But other than that, all's good.  As far as accuracy is concerned, this isn't our only scale at home and the weight results are pretty consistent throughout but regarding the other measurements, I have no way of calibrating the accuracy of those results so we've just been taking them with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, it puts me in the ""Obese"" range and I have no objections there."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Inwester,1057,202,"1) Price - 5 stars (I paid $35, but you can often find it at $30) 2) Built quality - Excellent, but could've been a bit bigger for accommodating all foot sizes - 4 stars 3) Accuracy / Measurements - Pretty decent, its always 0.6 lbs lower than my older scale, but I don't know which one is more accurate. At least this one is more consistent and doesn't fluctuate. Renpho scale like other smart scales uses sensors underneath your feet that use bio-electrical impedance. They are a guideline and should not be used as a proxy for medical results. 4) App - 5 stars (plenty have been written here, but its a very good app, well thought out, easy to use, and can track a lot of measurements. Your body measurements have to inputted manually, but all the other ones are calculated based on bio-electrical impedance. 5) Sync - I use Fitbit and it auto syncs - 5 stars Overall - 5 stars."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Nina Hopkins,265,103,"This is absolutely fanstastic. I’m an athlete and it’s even got athlete settings. The body fat seems a bit high but that could be my ego talking. Using a caliper and the Jackson pullock 7 method, I am 12.5% body fat and I feet that is true. Anyway the weight is what I was looking for. It’s syncs with my Fitbit app automatically. Great app. I know that my body isn’t the norm and if it were it would have diseased the body fat in, the rest is absolutely fantastic and I would recommend this to anyone who’s dying to know all of this information. Easy to setup and use. I’m so glad I tried this before spending the money in a Fitbit scale."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",3ptr,61,50,"When I look back at my Amazon order history, I realized I have been on the hunt for a digital scale with body fat composition for less than $50 since at least 2015 and this is my fifth one. I have purchased body fat scales mostly from Amazon but also from Target for over 10 years and I have been disappointed with the accuracy. I feel I have found the ""best one"" with the Renpho. Will this be my forever partner?  Here are some of the issues from OTHER scales: the measurements do not change from day to day. I had two scales that showed the exact measurement in EVERY category over 2 sometimes 3 consecutive days in a row (I don't think that is actually possible). I had some scales show dramatic changes when I weighed myself and then stepped off and then weighed again (like 2-3 pounds difference). Some scales take a long time to calculate the measurements and appear on the app (like 5 seconds - I know I am impatient, but I thought all scales took this long until I found Renpho). Sometimes the scales drained the batteries and required constant changing. I finally decided to change those scales into Goodwill sale items.  Renpho seems instantaneous and ""accurate"". I have had this scale for 3 weeks now and every day, there is a change, both positive and negative (I just can't quit you, Mr. Carbs! and keep me away from the salted Kerrygold butter, or that Ben and Jerry's nondairy PB & Cookies - the list is endless). I know people say not to weigh themselves every day, but sometimes, seeing the effect of 3 slices of deep dish pizza is enough to motivate myself not to do that again...well, at least for the rest of the week. COVID has been especially challenging and uncertain but at least for now Renpho has been reliable and steady.  I can't speak to the longevity but so far I am happy with the scale and the app."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Ted Pavlic,635,155,"I had not heard of this company before and was a little hesitant to try this scale and its app, but it had the features I was looking for. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The readings are very fast. A weight pops up quickly, and then it starts determining other body-mass parameters using impedance-based measurements. Those are transmitted to the app. The app can submit weight information to a number of targets. I have my scale submit my weight to Samsung Health and Fitbit, and I use other apps to then sync from Samsung Health to Google Fit and from Fitbit to WW. So basically I walk up to my scale, open my app, weigh myself, and have the peace of mind to know that my weight is updated across multiple electronic health eco-systems.  I use an Android device, and my wife uses an iPhone. We both use this scale. She is a ""friend"" in my app (and vice versa), which means that we both can see each others weight history. The scale stores weight information on the scale that has not been sync'd via Bluetooth. If I lived alone, this would be very convenient, as I would not always have to have my phone nearby when I weigh (because the weights would all be sync'd possibly days later when I finally did weigh myself with the app open nearby). However, the problem when you have two people using the scale is that all of the stored weight information gets sent over Bluetooth to the app that is open when a new weight is taken. When weights so not appear to be in the range of that user, the app asks the user which weights to keep, and all of the rest get deleted. So even though I am linked with my wife, her app cannot save new weights to my cloud record (and vice versa). This is mildly annoying, but it was a design decision on Renpho's part, and I respect that. It is not that big of a deal to have my phone nearby when I weigh in, and I like all of the other integration that occurs after that weigh in.  Impedance-based estimates of body fat percentage are known to be inaccurate. This scale can be configured (through the app) to use different calibration modes based on the athletism of the user. I think this probably helps to improve the measurements. Having said that, I have not verified my scale's readings. I take them with a pinch of salt, just like I would the impedance-based measurements of any other scale in this price range.  The profile of the scale is low. It is thin. The scale is small, but I have no problem standing on the four metal contacts to get a weight. It is easy to calibrate (just use one foot instead of two). Although scales like these shouldn't be used on carpet, if you have a solid slab to set them on (like the old end-table tabletop you can see my scale sitting on in the uploaded pictures), then you can store and use the scale in a closet with carpet. Aside from the minor annoyances above, I'm pretty happy with this scale."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Kindle Customer,299,106,"This scale has been quite accurate and easy to use until today when it stopped working. I had hints that there might be something wrong when I started inexplicably gaining weight although I had not altered my diet in spite of the holidays. Several days ago I gained 3 pounds, yesterday I gained 5 more and today I gained approximately 137.8 pounds. That was my clue that something was definitely wrong and it wasn't with. me. I tried everything my booklet suggested, changing batteries, recalibrating, checking Blue Tooth connection, etc., etc. I called customer service and got Debbie who was wonderful. I explained the problem and what I had done to fix it. Once she realized I had tried all her suggestions already, she said it was obvious that something had gone wrong and she would send me a new scale ASAP. I was still under warrantee, I'd had the scale only 10 months. That it broke when less than a year old was unfortunate but the Renfro customer service was so good I had to write a review and give the scale 5 stars. I'd buy it again simply due to the ease I had in dealing with Renpho. I was barely on the phone 15 minutes and the problem was solved!! Way to go, Renpho!!!!!"
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",BABC,94,35,"I am a pretty privacy conscious person, and am pretty knowledgeable - in a general way - about the kinds of things that can happen when products get tied to apps (lots of privacy issues, what if the company stops supporting the app? what if the co. goes bankrupt? what if they try to charge a fee etc). So far, my experience has been A+  Two things to get out of the way, 1st I probably wouldn't have bought this if I had known that the body-fat percentage sensor is recommended against for pregnant women and 2nd I haven't done serious research into who Renpho is or what they do with my data. The 1st part hasn't been a problem thus far and the second one makes me a bit queasy to think about.  So I bought it to lose some weight- I didn't understand how nice it would be to just have it recorded by bluetooth is. I, like most other people, weight myself right when I get up - and having to record my weight while I am barely awake is a problem I didn't know I needed solving. It feels significantly easier and convenient to have it saved with only the opening of an app and a step on the scale.  I enjoy the body fat percentage and other ""details"" they give but am dubious how accurate they really are so i try not to put too much weight in them. Nice to have but probably not too reliable vs other more intrusive methods.  I guess the person I want this review to reach is someone who has a need for a scale but doesn't want to use an app or their phone - if you want to track your weight Google Fit and Apple health have really made it a cinch to easily track your weight and provide access to other apps to help you plan your diet based on whatever weight goals you have. So you can make great graphs, make a diet that reflects what you weigh exactly the day you are eating etc. It's super convenient."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",Tim,51,51,"For the same price (or less) that you'd pay for a basic digital scale at the supermarket, you can get this one that can automatically record measurements into your health app. Seems accurate enough, I weighed myself the day I went to the doctor and they were within a few pounds of each other, difference probably because I had my shoes on at the doctor's. I've no idea if the other readings besides weight and BMI are accurate. After about a year of weighing in every week or so there haven't been any durability issues, but I'm not a heavy guy so YMMV."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",ibrahim.shadid,7,21,"I used to have more sophisticated and more expensive scale than this, I can confirm that the accuracy of this scale is around 80% compared to the specialized scale, it will miss a little bit in the FAT and MUSCLE measurements. Pros: for a 30$ scale the option you can get, the measurement, the ability to follow up with each and every measurement, the fact that it is all written and can come back to it, the option of keeping track for multiple users and more... all that with 30$ that is a great product..  Cons: - a little bit light, you feel like it could break but it will not. - every time you need to use you have to open the Bluetooth & Location on your mobile phone to sync. - connects with Google fit and Samsung health, with the weight only, not other data."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",AB,227,101,"Easy setup. The scale arrived today. I opened the box, took the scale out (it's inside another box inside the Amazon box and was well protected with foam inserts on both top and bottom of the glass scale). I put in the three included AAA batteries and set it on the hardwood floor in my dining room. Then I read through the included instructions and downloaded the RENPHO app to my Android phone (made sure Bluetooth was enabled). I entered basic info into the app - preferred weight unit (the app offers kilos, stones, or pounds), preferred height unit (the app offers cm or in), DOB, height, etc. At first I manually entered weight but I had no idea what my body fat was or what it should be so I actually Googled that and got an idea. For a woman over 50, somewhere in the 20 percent range would be a good goal. I also noted that they have an Athlete mode which you can select if you work out regularly and have been doing so long before you bought the scale. This keeps things like BMI from being way off for someone who is muscular. I did not select that mode, but nice to know it is available.  I waited a few minutes, then stood on the scale and let it flash and do its thing. It calculated my weight and body fat and much more. I had no idea and the numbers are somewhat horrifying, but now I can use the app to see not only weight and BMI, but body fat percentage, fat-free body weight, subcutaneous fat percentage, visceral fat, body water percentage, skeletal muscle percentage, pounds of muscle mass, pounds of bone mass, percentage of protein, and the number of calories for my basal metabolic rate.  I also pretty easily synced the RENPHO app with my Fitbit app. The Fitbit app updated with my new weight from the Renpho scale, so it seems to be working. I was also able to add my body fat weight and goal to my fitbit app, now that I have that information.  Finallly, I registered my new Renpho scale on the Renpho website using the Amazon order number - per the included directions.  Overall. I am very pleased. I just hope everything keeps working as well as it is right now."

On a general point, I’m not completely convinced that these types of scales can truly measure the other stats, but it’s definitely accurate in reading weight. I recommend to anyone looking for an easy-to-use smart scale."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",emma,423,115,"Love the fact that it is double sided, and the feel of both sides is great. I love that it looks and feels close to real leather!

So if you're looking for that leather look and feel but don't want to buy the expensive leather mats or don't want to use animal products (like me) this is a great alternative. I'll be getting these as gifts for friends and family in the future. It's the perfect size for my desk and just look high quality! You won't be disappointed if you buy this desk mat!  When you first get it the ends won't lay flat, I just rolled my the opposite for a little bit and laid it flat on my desk and it lays flat now.

The additional details are helpful although I am a bit skeptical on how to really authenticate the information on body water, muscle weight, etc. It is however, good to watch from a comparative perspective well over week.  I use the product daily and has worked flawlessly until now.  Not Tested: I have not had the ability to test multiple profiles on the product yet; more on that in time.  I can also not comment on the durability for I have had this only for a couple months. On the outside, the product looks sturdy and no hiccups yet. Will continue to monitor.

"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",MA,819,87,"My oldest son bought this scale and bought it over to show us. You put the app on your phone, stand on it and it chimes and gives you all the breakdowns of your body makeup. You can see if your bones are good, your muscle mass, what percentage fat your body is, your BMI, your metabolic age, fat around your organs, percentage fat in your entire body compared to muscle mass. Tells you if you're drinking enough water or eating enough protein.  We were so impressed that we bought one for ourselves. Then my younger son came over and he was so impressed he bought one for himself and his household. Then i bought another one for a good friend. NOTHING has made me lose weight. But when i saw my fat percentage, how low my water intake was, that i wasn't eating enough protein, and what my metabolic age really is, I realized I have to do something about it.  We've had the scale a month. we weight ourselves on Saturdays. All of us are eating better. I cut sugar from my diet. I've added protein to lunch and dinner, i'm drinking juice flavored water (not a water drinker) throughout the day, I think twice before I put food into my mouth. And it tells you when you are making improvements. My water levels has gone up, my protein intake has gone up. 3 of my sons are exercising daily and eating better too.  It's been almost a month. I've lost 6 lbs, my son has lost 5 and I don't know about my other son because I haven't spoken to him lately. This scale was a great price. Even if it's not 100% accurate like going to a professional doctor, it opens your eyes to how bad your body makeup really is. When you are informed, you do better.  You will not be disappointed. I really believe this scale can save lives. Fix yourself by controlling your diet and raise your numbers where you're low and decrease the numbers where you're too high. Amazing tool!!!! We love it."
"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",FON,358,155,"Great Accurate Scale. lover the Bluetooth interface. Easy to set up. My wife and I can now track our weight and BMI, Body Fat etc. and it syncs right to our FitBit and Apple Health Apps. All independent of one another. I read some comments that you can't have multiple people share the Scale/App. THIS IS NOT TRUE. You can have many people in your household share it, all independently.  It can be a little confusing so let me tell you the best way to do it. Within ther App you can ""Add A Member"" but this is NOT the way to effectively do it. It just means others are sharing your account.  Here is how to set it up properly:  On your phone download the Renpho App and create an account with your email and PW. Then follow the prompts to set up your account.  On your Spouses (or other persons) phone have them download the Renpho App and set up their own account, with their email and PW. Then they also follow the prompts to set up their account.  Now if you want to use the Renpho Scale and track your information all you need to do is launch the App on YOUR Phone. After you've weighed yourself QUIT the App.  Now your Spouse (or other person) can launch the App on their phone and weigh themselves. Once done they too need to quit the App.  That's the trick and key, both people can not have the App running at the same time. Unlike having separate devices and sharing an App, you are having the same App share ONE device so it makes sense that you need to have separate accounts and quit the App on your phone in order for the next person to be able to use the Scale (Device) on their App and Account. It's not as complicated as it sounds. 3 Steps... Launch the App, Weigh yourself, Quit the App.  This scale is far better than the ""Troubled"" FitBit Aria 2 WiFi Scale for a fraction of what that one costs. And this one WORKS while the Fitbit Aria 2 is plagued with problems. Bluetooth is a much more sensable way to interface as well."

"RENPHO 蓝牙体脂分析仪, ES-CS20M-B, 1",arc,145,59,"Accuracy - compared to our old electronic non RENPHO scale it was virtually exact. Repeated, closely timed weighings yielded virtually the exact same result (+-.2-3 lbs) The weight and BMI I assume to be very accurate. The rest I don’t have a reliable measure. That said as long as those figures track to each other (ie they don’t vary significantly each day) they seem to be a reasonable measure to themselves, and that’s where the value is. I had no problems with Bluetooth either setting it up or the scale connecting to my iPhone. I found the scale wouldn’t connect my iPhone from across the house but in the same room it would. With the app opened after a few minutes the Bluetooth symbol would appear in the app and the new data would down load. The data transferred to the health app seamlessly which is a good thing. I tried to delete one reading and ended up deleting a weeks worth. The iOS health app still had the basic data. Reading a few reviews of the app, it seems that it can either through user error (me) or after and update delete data so back it up. Once deleted there is no way to get the data back (that should be fixed in the app) Would I buy the scale again, sure, I just wish I would have bought it a few years ago. It’s easy to hide 10 pounds of weight in clothes, you can’t hide it from a scale. UPDATE. I’m changing my rating to five stars. The minor complaints I have are nothing compared to the positives of the scale. The scale does occasionally reads a bit different between closely spaced weigh ins. (Like maybe every couple days and maybe ½ to 1 pound) Here’s my suggestion if that bugs you. Weigh yourself as many times a day as you want, 1, 2, 5 times. Pick the lowest weight and, with caution so you do it right, delete every weight except the lowest one. Problem solved. If you have another app which can access the RENPHO app data, make sure to set that up. The Bluetooth seems to be working better, it downloaded the data without activating the scale. This scale, like a mirror, doesn’t let you hide. If you want to lose weight, this scale is another arrow in your quiver. It won't displace your will power but it will enhance it. Good luck!"

I love being able to keep track of all my weekly weigh-ins on the app. I love that it keeps running tally of how many pounds I've lost since my first weigh-in. It also records other statistics such as BMI, body fat, muscle mass, BMR, body water, visceral fat percentage and more! You can create additional accounts on the app if you have other people in your household who use the scale. This scale could cost way more than it does. It is such a good deal!!

This is the BEST pill organizer, because you can actually disassemble it and load your pills easily without having to mess with holding the lids up. I found this out quite by surprise, and here it is. Carefully unlock each of the boxes and raise the lids to upward position, then pull carefully from one end and both lid covers will lift out of the center slot. Load your pills as usual, then carefully replace the lids, inserting them from one end to the other. Make sure that the little slots between the two covers match up. It may be a little hard to do this, but after you have done it a couple of times, it becomes easier. If you take as many pills as I do, you will LOVE THIS!"

But I can tell right away why some people are having difficulty keeping the doors latched. I found this out very quickly.  I took it apart to wash it out, dried it, and could not get the compartment doors to latch after that. I quickly realized that each line of doors (that do come out, which I had done to wash it), has to line up and connect with the other line of doors at certain points. They have something like clips that connect the line of doors to one another. They need to be latched together and then put back in as a unit before they are in the correct position to close and latch the doors properly. If people are having problems getting the doors to latch, they should take out both of these lines of doors and try aligning and snapping them together, and then putting them back in. I’ll bet that would solve the problem instantly. I imagine that with daily use, they kind of get off track.  This holder fits a lot of pills, but I don’t know how good they are for traveling. If you wanted to keep them in a purse, for example, the unit might be too large fo you. Also, EACH SIDE DOES NOT SEPARATE ONE FROM ANOTHER, as I thought they did. It is a unit of 14 compartments that are permanently part of the plastic tray. No separating them.  Size of the compartments: I fit one large gummy calcium, one large Allegra tablet, one long Prilosec, one K2 soft tablet, one low-dose aspirin, and two gummy vitamins. I will attempt to upload pictures to show how much space is in each compartment.  If this organizer doesn’t last long and doors break after a number of months of daily use, I will remind myself that it is an inexpensive item and can be replaced. For now, I’m happy with my purchase."

One has been poor, with doors that wouldn't latch and lids that broke off. I originally gave it 5 stars but now think that 3 is more appropriate overall.  This is a large pill organizer, so if you take lots of meds or supplements, this is a great one to use. Overall outside dimensions are 4.5"" x 9"" x 1"" deep. Each compartment holds several large capsules; there are 14 compartments.  The problem I've had with other organizers is that the compartments weren't large enough or lids either wouldn't close securely, or would open unexpectedly, spilling the pills all over the place. This one is well designed, the lids snap shut and snap open when you press the release tab on individual compartments. Some other reviews mentioned having trouble operating the lids, but I found them to be simple, reliable and easy to use.  I've tried many organizers, some were so poorly made that I threw them out after a couple days. This one is very solidly made and I'd definitely recommend it."

Sole,424,79,"I purchased this item to replace another one that I had been using, that was the same size and was nearly identical (except that the colors were blue and red, not lavender and baby blue) and it had lasted me several years. The reason I had to replace it was bc after I got one of my daily doses out, I had apparently not closed that days lid all the way, so when I shut my nightstand drawer it snapped it off. And then later another lid would no longer close & latch and so THAT lid would remain open too. I have to take multiple pills in the a.m. & p.m. so having lids that actually close & latch is a MUST for me. With that being said, I recieved this one less than two weeks ago and one of the lids will not stay closed or latched. It has not been mishandled or used. It is brand spanking new! Unfortunately, I had to purchase ANOTHER one - the exact same one - bc I need one that is this exact size, etc... And this was the only one available that is in this style/size and I literally just recieved it less than an hour ago. I will leave an updated review under that purchase after a little while of use. I am hoping that it was just a manufacturing issue or error, but I guess I am about to find out. If this one breaks, I WILL actually ask for a refund this time. I just hate the hassle of dealing with refunds."

This isn't the first time about these, the first set I've used for probably 8 years and I liked him so much that I bought another set. The only reason I bought more is because one of the lids started breaking but I really love that you can actually take the lids completely off of the pill box to fill the little slots. otherwise you're having to reach up underneath each one to drop the pills in and it's a real pain in the butt."

After doing this for a few weeks I also noticed multiple lids wouldn't stay closed when dumping out my pills and would end up dropping my pills all over the place. I finally just replaced it with a dollar tree pill box which held my large amount of pills better than this unit. I also struggled to get all my pill lids closed after filling them up before chucking it out. For $10 you'd think it would be better constructed, it used to hold all my daily 14 pills in various sizes but didn't work out and a waste of money. This unit is too eye catching with the colors and spring action that it unfortunately attracted children's curiosity to play with it. I'm being careful about leaving it out from now on and minded them not to play with my medicine box."

He likes that he can fill it on Sunday morning and then all he has to do is remember to take it with him on the go.  It's about the size of a book so it holds a lot of pills. If you only take a couple a day this might be bigger than you'd like to cart around, but if you have a large handful of pills to remember to take everyday, this is an absolute must!!"

The pockets are also large enough to hold quite a few pills. I take Calcium which are humongous, Centrum, Joint Pills and CLA 3000... four very large pills. I also take blood pressure, an allergy, and another prescription pill. That's 7 pills and they easily fit in the pocket for AM... Same goes for the evening... another 7 pills and the pocket holds them easily too. Other containers didn't have large enough pockets to get everything in there. I have three of these because I like them so much and they are simple to fill... no trouble if you're a little shakey getting those pills in the right slots. Everything snaps together fairly well and I'm done for three weeks.

From the buttons to open one section, to the locking system (which works well), to the size of the daily compartments, to the durability. This container provide the ability to push one button and then turn the whole container over to only pour out the one AM or PM slot into your hand. I’ve been using the container for a month and have no complaints (however, I have had less success with other pill contains from the same manufacturer).  Pros: • Large Compartments hold multiple capsules/tablets (more than 8 including large fish oil pills) • Strong Locks (when it clicks shut you don’t have to worry about it coming open) • Durable (lids do not break off easily - I have been using them for a month now) • Open Buttons are easy to use and effective • Provide confidence on whether this morning or evenings medications were taken, no second guessing  Cons: • Does not fit in a crossbody or small satchel bag. Would fit into a tote or larger bag. • Not discrete if trying to take medications in a large room (ex: conference) as the individual days do not pull out of the container (which is a good thing overall as it increases durability) • Will make the sound of pills moving back and forth as you walk, which is easily identifiable by others around you  Overall, I definitely recommend this case. Hope it works well for you also."

I ordered this set because I like the colors, the little suns and moons, and because of the latches which open each compartment instead of them having to be pried open. One thing I hadn't noticed on Amazon was that the night side of the dispensers had the days in reverse order. That seems very strange to me. I carefully pried off the night covers and re-arranged them into the proper order. I haven't started using these yet but I think they will work fine.

The lock works well and to open you just press the tab and it pops open making this great for people with arthritis. However!!! This also means that you need to place this at secure or high spots because kids will easilyyyy open this and it will be fun for them to press the tabs.

This is actually great for me, because I keep my morning pills in the bathroom for when I get ready, and the night time ones on my bedside table, because I have a bad habit of forgetting to take my night pills, until I either see them as I am getting into bed or my phone alarm reminds me. But being able to have them right there at night, is great because sometimes I get all the way ready for bed and am all tucked in by the time I realize I forgot to take my night time pills. For the feature of keeping my day and night pills in separate locations alone was worth the purchase. The compartments themselves are nice and large. Perhaps too big for some people, if you only need to take a few small pills, but this larger size of the containers is actually good for my needs, since I take probiotics that need to stay in their blister pack until I am ready to take it, and that takes up a bit more space.  So yes, this is a very easy recommendation for me to make."

I like not having to triple check myself that I am taking from the PM side and not the AM side in error. I simply know blue is AM and purple is PM. I will hang onto the rainbow one as a backup in case my new one breaks though. I already have the one compartment/day Medium EZ dose weekly organizer that is a nice size for my afternoon dose. I put that one in a ziplock bag, and keep it in my purse. If I am out and about when my afternoon dose is due I will always have my pills with me. The Med organizer has held up great, and the lids have always stayed closed when they were supposed to! I just wanted to share my experience with the rainbow colored ones. I didn't think it would make any difference to me, but I do prefer a designated color for AM vs PM."

I would say it’s travel friendly if you can insure that the button cannot be pushed. I have dropped it when it was full of medicine and I have mistakenly tossed it across the room because it was on my bed when I shook my blanket and didn’t realize it.

Well it did break on one of the compartments but it was easy to repair. This thing is tough and resilient. I also like how the days of the week haven’t faded.

Well this one is right in the middle of that it is perfect! There are locking mechanisms on it but they are just strong enough to keep everything secure yet don't require monster strength to pop open. If you need daily pill sorting as well and have arthritis or just want your meds secure this is the product for you! I highly recommend!"
"EZY DOSE 按钮(7 天)药丸,药品,维生素组织者 | 每周,每天 2 次,上午/下午 | 大隔间| 关节炎友好 | 透明盖",B. Applegate,835,150,"This pill storage is perfect for keeping am and pm pills separated. Each compartment snaps shut tightly and opens by pushing down on the white tab in the front. Each lid has the day and either a sun or a moon symbol. Most of the reviews are for the clear pill storage box but I bought the one with different colors. The week of morning compartments and the week of afternoon compartments are attached and can be taken out of a tray. They each snap into the tray and set firmly in there. But if you want just one compartment for each day, you can take one week's worth out from the tray, either the am ones or the pm ones. I'm very happy with this pill storage device."

He had one old one that was faded that he really liked. He is no lover of change and so I had to find the same kind. I’m taking over his meds he is 87 and getting confused and can’t see well. So I fill up two weeks and put little stickers with a date on them. He is now in the pattern of taking them out on the right date. I also am able to order a refill when I’m refilling your the empty ones. I love these containers because they hold a lot. I’ve only opened two but no problem with them opening or closing or pills falling out. I left out a star because the container itself is not as solid as their old one. Very happy I ordered 3 at that price.

I'm filling it up as soon as I finish writing this review. ;)  I've had several different sizes of pill minders for the last 30 years or so, but this one really is the best. The number of my pills have increased as I've gotten older - naturally - and this will hold all of them with ease. I have 9 pills to take every morning, 5 at night. My Metformin tablets are the largest, and in the past, have made it difficult to fit everything for morning into one segment. Plenty of room in this one, with room to expand.  Yes, it's big; but not as huge as the one my mother used towards the end of her life, and a lot easier to use, plus less confusing. Love the color-coding for am/pm. The lids open easily with the push buttons, but close securely, with a *snap* you can feel. Too many times, I've bought other organizers with lids that popped open at a bare touch, leading to a rain of pills. This one is solid. And the ease of use makes it much more likely it'll get faithfully used. No struggling with dratted lid after lid after lid when filling.  Speaking of solid, it's a sturdy piece of work. If my cats decide to knock it off onto the floor (not that my sweet babies would ever think of doing that, oh no...LOL), it'll stand up to the impact just fine. I'm betting it'd also be fine if someone accidentally sat on it, though I don't plan to test that anytime soon. ;) But I'm sure it'd survive being stuffed into a backpack or over-stuffed carry-on.  Bonus, it's pretty sleek, actually looks sort of stylish, and the colors are cheery. Not things that are necessary, precisely, but it's sort of nice that it doesn't look as clunky as most organizers."

I only take two pulls at night and one in the morning so the product is a little large for my needs but works fine.

So far, after two months of use by hubby, each compartment closes well. I wish I had purchased these pillholders years ago!"

I will probably travel with it later this year, and we'll see how well it goes. I ordered the XL and the compartments are really big, which is what I was looking for. I put 6 large pills in a compartment with room to spare. They're also curved on the inside, which makes getting the pills out much easier. The whole unit is quite big, but I don't mind because I like the features that provides. The buttons work well! they are easy to press, and they're sized well. My fingers don't slip off of them trying to press them. The colors are nice, slightly more pastel than pictured, and it's transparent enough to see what you have in there. It has little rubber discs on the bottom that help keep it from sliding around, & that was a nice surprise. I don't accidentally drag it off of the counter trying to get things out of it.  The only drawback I've found so far (but not a big deal to me) is that the lids don't always ""snap"" when they lock, so sometimes I have to double check whether they locked by trying to open them. It seems to be improving with use, but I'm not sure if that's just optimism talking."

This dispenser makes it easier to tell am from pm. Also easier for opening. I love that. Only bad thing I actually have to say is when I've stopped my case the locks are easily popped open so when traveling you should put in a plastic bag for just in case they have popped open. Other than that only bad thing is I've had the days of the week wear off quickly but normally I don't look at them just the colors for am. and PM
"EZY DOSE 按钮(7 天)药丸,药品,维生素组织者 | 每周,每天 2 次,上午/下午 | 大隔间| 关节炎友好 | 透明盖",Lindsey,475,147,"This has very roomy compartments. I took a picture to show that it could fit my personal arsenal of medicines and vitamins from the kidney bean sized Omega 3 pills to the tiny D3 capsules. When you take a variety of pills, you'll find the textures vary from powdery tablets that stick to all surfaces of your mouth in bitterness to silky smooth capsules one can swallow dry, you want the pills to have room. You don't want your pills to stick together because then they can become difficult to swallow. I bought one for me and one for my boyfriend. He complained about the difficulty in accessing his pills. I think that I would prefer the compartments to be hard to open because I am butterfingered due to neuropathy. Things slip from my grasp. This product has hard plastic that I am sure will not spill my pills all over the floor when the entire thing is dropped."

We use this for our dogs pills as he is on daily meds for a condition he has and it takes the thinking out of which pills to give when. It is a little large so would not recommend for traveling. We have had this for about a month with no issues.

I also like how easy it is to open them all up and fill them back up once a week. My only criticism is that when traveling with the holder, the compartment areas have a tendency to be pushed open and the pills spill out. If it had a better locking mechanism for travel, it would be ideal. Good and sturdy and a value for the money."

We take a lot of pills and vitamin supplements and this was a great way to organize them before we left and keep track of taking them daily. We used them for our whole trip, and filled the co tai era up each week so we didn’t have to get Pills out every day from their No larger containers."
"EZY DOSE 按钮(7 天)药丸,药品,维生素组织者 | 每周,每天 2 次,上午/下午 | 大隔间| 关节炎友好 | 透明盖",Lynda Dunbar,1230,845,"I bought this for my husband who has moderate memory problems. Over the last year, he's gotten pretty good about remembering to take his 2 blood pressure meds at bedtime (even though I usually set them up for him each night). Several months ago he started a new med for his chronic migraines that he has to take twice a day. The morning dose has been an ongoing problem. Many times he's forgotten to take the morning dose, and unless I either see or hear him take it or he tells me he took it, then it remains an unsolved mystery as to whether he did or didn't. So I got this case to try to remedy that. It's working great. The color coding and easy to read day of the week and am/pm makes it easy for him to tell which to take and makes it easy for both of us to tell whether he's taken it or not. The little colored tabs are easy to press down which pops the top for that particular compartment. They snap shut easily. The size of the compartments are more than adequate for his pills (they could hold a lot more than just the 3 he takes), and the compartments are big enough for him to get his big fingers into. I don't recommend turning it upside down to dump the meds out into your hand though because that makes it too easy to bump the other tabs and pop the tops on them, in which case you'd have several open and spill. This does work really well and we're both really happy with it. We do still have to keep it on the kitchen counter, so he'll remember (you know.... out of sight, out of mind) and he says it takes up a lot of counter space. While it does take up more than the 3 pill bottles, it's not THAT big, and doesn't interfere with our daily routines. Plus, it also helps you keep track of what day of the week it is. My husband now needs glasses for reading but he can read the print on the pill case without his glasses, which is a bonus. If you have anyone who takes meds twice a day, is forgetful, and/or has arthritis, I definitely recommend this."
"EZY DOSE 按钮(7 天)药丸,药品,维生素组织者 | 每周,每天 2 次,上午/下午 | 大隔间| 关节炎友好 | 透明盖",Tr@cie,1475,278,"I originally purchased this medication dosage container at the request of my husband who apparently thinks it's a waste of his time to unscrew three medication bottles per day in order to take his meds. He gets two weeks worth of dosing from this container because his three meds are taken in the morning. Now I take several vitamins and supplements along with a few prescriptions; so I ordered another one for myself. This case has been one of my better purchases and I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner.  The overall measurements are 4.5"" x 9"" x 1"" with easy to read lettering for each day. Each receptacle is large enough to hold the biggest pills (think calcium supplements) and then some. To open all you do is push down on the individual tab which is a great feature for those who have arthritis, weakness or hand mobility issues. I had one incident where I didn't close the lid completely and yes obviously the pills fell out. So double checking the lids are snapped shut is just common sense. After reading some other reviews, I would recommend making sure this is the size you are looking for. Often times photos can be misleading as to the actual size of a product, always check measurements prior to purchase."

The first one lasted almost 7 years of daily use until the Thursday morning door flap broke off one day. The locking mechanisms are great and keep your medications from spilling out when used for traveling and the door flaps are easy to open. I tried several other brands before getting my first one of these and this design and quality is the best that I have found. Whoever makes these did a great job. I will most likely buy another one in another 7 years or so.

Good quality and I do like the “locking“ feature, though I wouldn’t trust it if I threw it in a bag to travel. It’s more like a “press down to open” than a true lock or childproof lid. I wouldn’t travel with it, but who’s traveling now anyways? I think it would be great for someone with arthritis that struggles to pry the lids open on traditional pill organizers"

They wold not be good for travel in my opinion, because they are so large, but for home use, these were the best I could find, and I am very satisfied.

I’m not sure it will last a long time, that remains to be seen—but for the moment at least, I’m 100% satisfied with it and glad to have found it. Another big win from Amazon!"

I have read reviews in the past that said these pop open too easily. And, I've had that happen to me. Hopefully these newer ones are better. But, if not I still give them 5 stars. They are easy to open with fat klutzy fingers - mine. And, they are large enough to hold all of my pills. I've found no others that come close to fulfilling my needs.  Now about the popping open. I always lay then upright. When opening a section, I put my fingers on the sections next to it to keep those closed while clicking just one open. And, when packing in luggage I put a rubber band around each side,I haven't, knock on wood, had any spilled pills in a long time.  I paid full price for these and still give my honest impression.

I think the opening mechanism is nice, especially for those who have joint problems in wrist or fingers. It holds at least 6 big capsule pills.  But I wouldn't say it looks like a reliable item in terms of longevity; the plastic feels a little thin, albeit sturdy. Im concerned it would break if I dropped it from a high enough height if the capsules were open, or if something about 3lbs fell on it.

This is the first pill container that I actually like. First off, it's big enough to hold my pills. This isn't usually too much of an issue to me, to be honest. It's sturdy and not cheap. That's the biggest issue I usually have. I take my pills to work and when I travel, and usually I am looking for three qualities in a pill holder: size (to hold the pills), quality of construction, ability to hold the pills in. You don't usually get 3/3 but here you do. What I mean is, often I would have to tape my pill containers shut, or they were quality but not big enough, etc.  To give you an idea...in the morning I have two naproxen, two large fish oil Omega-3, a multivitamin, two large BCAA pills. In the evening switch the multivitamin for two large glucosamine pills. Still plenty of room. There aren't a lot of pills, but aside from the naproxen, are all fairly large."

At first I thought it was too large for her to manage easily, but she is happy with it. Personally, I feel the pills are a bit difficult to extract from the little compartments - with smaller units she could just turn the thing upside down - but she manages. So far, the lids pop up with a push and snap shut securely, assuring no spilled pills. I'm a little tentative about it because I don't know how long the plastic will last before the lids start falling off. Mom isn't too happy with much these days, but she does appreciate the Ezy Dose."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Little Bitty,783,178,"I have purchased over a dozen of these. I have had a herniated disk and sciatica pain for 30+ years. A long time ago I purchased one of these from my doctor for $260. This same exact unit. Now I have 3 at home and everyone I know has one I have bought for them. This is the same exact unit my doctor sold me so you know it is good. I have bought some little off brand white ones that did not work as well. This is the one. order some extra replacement pads and batteries and you are set. You can use it anywhere you have pain, neck, shoulder, knee, lower back. Look online for instructions on where to place the pads for whatever hurts. This is a nerve blocker. You get temporary pain relief with no drugs. You have to try this. You can clip it on your waistband and wear it everywhere, except the airport. I tried that and had a note from the doctor but I still got a complete and thorough pat down and almost missed my plane. Stick it in your check in luggage without the batteries if you have to travel with it."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Honest Reviewer,15564,119,"So thankful I purchased this. I had experience with a smaller, less powerful unit bought at CVS, but even that was helpful. This TENS unit is a lifesaver for me in helping to manage my pain issues. The best part is that you can set it and then there are safety covers that protect the unit, so you don't have to worry about settings being accidentally changed while wearing. I often wear it on continuous mode for hours, even leaving the house with it all strapped on and hidden under my clothing. It has been a God-send. In my opinion, this device is more effective than pain medications and muscle relaxers (for those of us who have built up a tolerance to medications), and is certainly less toxic to the system.  If you're wondering if this is powerful enough, this is one strong little unit that runs on a single 9 volt battery. I never set this higher than about 3.5 and it goes up to 8! You can set it as gentle or strong as you want. You can choose different modes and tweak adjustments. I purchased a set of rechargeable 9 volt batteries with a small recharging unit and I honestly can't believe how long the batteries last. (EBL 840 9V Battery Charger with 4 Pack 600mAh Li-ion Rechargeable 9 Volt Batteries)  UPDATE Aug. 2017: I've used this unit for 4 months and it got me through a really horrible time where I was suffering from knotted shoulders and trapezius with terrible trigger points that were so bad I was unable to sleep on either shoulder for nearly 4 full months. The pain radiated down into my upper arms and it felt like I needed rotator cuff surgery due to the muscles all cramping so much. I was seeking chiropractic and massage therapy once a week and taking pain meds around the clock. I finally had to have cortisone injections in 5 major trigger points, but the ONLY thing that truly helped break the cycle of pain and get me through the worst of it before the cortisone was this TENS machine. I can not recommend this unit enough for those suffering from pain.  UPDATE Sept. 2017: Well, unfortunately, the unit quit working a few days before I had to travel, so I was forced to buy another one to replace it. The digital display all works, it cycles through everything, but the wires and pads do nothing. I even tried the wires and pads from my new unit, but to no avail. Although I had to wait a month to go through the manufacturer, I was fully refunded for the product and my new one works fine. My original review was 5 stars, dropped to 3 while I waited for a refund, and am leaving it at 4 stars because the seller did take care of the issue and the new unit seems to be working fine (although I did just get it a month ago). I will update if anything changes, but I still stand by the fact that it is a terrific unit when it works!"

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Tony DiMancari,807,263,"I just bought this as a second unit to use at home. It's the most affordable and versatile TENS unit with 5 different settings and an easy 9v battery. It's light weight with a convenient belt clip. I ordered the second one so that my wife and I can use them at the same time or I can treat multiple areas at once. I use this to treat lower back issues due to a bulging disk (helps with the muscle strain and spasms, but will not reduce disk swelling), sciatica, and a rotator cuff injury. I've found it greatly reduces tight muscles, muscle spasms, and perceived localized pain. For less than $25, everyone should own a unit.  Here's a couple tips to get the most out of it. 1. Wipe off the area with alcohol first. This will take away lotion and oil so that your pads last longer and stick better. 2. Search online for TENS pad placement diagrams. There are a lot of articles and images that will tell you where to place the pads for any problem. 3. Buy a set of rechargeable 9V batteries. I've had great luck with the Tenergy TN141 2 Bay 9V Smart Charger with 2 pcs 9V 250mah NiMH Rechargeable Batteries from Amazon. 4. Buy extra pads and cables. The cables last one or more years, but will wear out eventually or when pinched. The pads can last a month to a year. I like ones that stick well and change pads every couple weeks. 5. You can use cold pack wraps to hold the pads in place and ice at the same time."

About 2 weeks ago it started draining the 9-volt battery after one use. At first we thought it was bad batteries or he left it on.  Last night we put in a brand-new fresh battery, he turned it on, it lasted less than 10 minutes. We turned it off and set it aside while I looked through the manual. Then I smelled hot plastic. We took the battery out -- it was so hot my husband TOOK IT OUTSIDE, AFRAID IT MIGHT EXPLODE OR MELT. I don't know what might have happened if I had put the unit back in the case.

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Kara,1347,125,"Since trying a few different brands, I'm impressed and love this TENS unit! The unit's options are more than I expected -different massaging modes, rate of massage, and time between the next set of stimulation. My favorite is the timer option because I usually fall asleep without pain keeping me awake. The clip is very sturdy. The intensity dials have a plastic cover -no more accidental intense stimulations! The unit's options also have a cover that protects it well. The cables are sturdy and the price is truly unbeatable with the quality of the product.  The only drawback are the flimsy pads. I know many people love the pads; however after receiving my unit on Sunday, the pads failed to adhere to my skin on Monday. On Wednesday one of the pad's conductive gel peeled off the pad. I kept the pads on the clear plastic base whenever not using the unit, and I used a conductive, TENS-specific gel. You can see the one peeling pad and the adhesiveness of the other pads within the pictures posted. In 2 pictures, you can see green-colored tape on my skin next to the pad. I used a plastic packet to lightly touch the tape's edge, showing the Scotch tape holds well on my skin. I then used my plastic packet to lightly touch the pad's edge, showing the loss of adhesiveness.  I love my TENS unit despite the pads and am happy I chose this one. The price and additional features are worth it! Since I would need new pads down the road anyway, it's not a big deal! If you decide to purchase this unit, I think you'll love the results!"

But i was running into the issue of the strength not being srtong enough after a few uses. I was having to keep getting new 9V batteries even though the battery itself was almost new. Essentially, i wanted the TENS unit to be a little stronger for my back. So i decided to hack the unit to take 12V (8x AA batteries) instead. Now the batteries last a lot longer without me having to replace them and also it's stronger. I've been using it a few days and the circuit seems to be fine with 12V going through it."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Patricia Rawlings,476,84,"This little device is mighty powerful. I have shoulder impingement syndrome which is so painful. I've been using the TENS for two days now. I'm only using one connection (two patches)--this is plenty. I've done about twenty 30-minute sessions and have it at the intensity setting number two, which is just enough. I don't have the nerve to try the higher settings! I like the Normal setting which gives a continuous, unvarying tingling. I don't know how it works but it nips the pain down to a very low level and makes it tolerable. I have to learn to turn the little knob off when it finishes because I just learned that this will drain your battery if you leave it turned on after the 30 minutes are off and it stops--which is hard to do! That's the only thing I see as a bit of a drawback but I will just have to tie a string on my finger or put a rubber band on my wrist to make me remember! I love it! It works!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Feel The Need To Read!,1018,97,"This tens unit has just the right amount of power behind it, small size and features to make it a must have for those with MS, muscle or nerve pain. I have used the high-end medical units available from neurologists so I have some experience to compare this with. The housing isn't as nice as some of the higher-end commercial units, but the electrical configuration options are comparable. The housing is a bit too lightweight and is obviously plastic, but it is much sturdier than it feels. I would prefer it to be a bit more rugged, but it hasn't broken or worn out yet and I have used mine often. This very small-sized and lightweight unit is very portable. You can even wear it when you work or walk as it is unnoticeable. Unit does fit in pocket or on a belt.  I like that I can control the settings thoroughly and that I have two output channels. This works great for lower back pain, pinched nerves and for residual pain from cramping in the legs, forearms and wrists. For those who live with neuropathy, this type of therapy is a nice option as it allows you to get some comfort and treat nerve pain exactly where it needs to be treated without taking medication.  The best part about this product is that results are evident in a short amount of time. I can get satisfactory results with each use. Sometimes I put it on low and just run it for 30 to 40 minutes while I read, work on the computer or watch tv. Other times I use it for only 5 to 10 minutes. It just depends on where it needs to be used and what setting I go with.  *It should be noted that this gizmo has decent power output and runs for a long time off of one 9v battery. You do not need to ""amp"" up the output to painful settings to achieve effective results. The modulation setting is perfect for the wrists, hands, and forearms. I also find that is a great setting for the back. I hardly ever go above a 4.5, but a setting of 3 to 4.5 works fine on most modes. The output power is contingent upon your output pwm ""time"" setting. If the ratio of on to off is high, a lower output setting is needed. However, setting smaller, quicker, less powerful jolts has a very soothing effect on the nerves and results in a pleasant, soothing treatment with long-lasting results.  The pads are comfortable--not overly sticky or gooey but nonetheless result in excellent adhesion. They will not last long if you treat yourself often, so stock up. If you clean your treatment site thoroughly, then you will get anywhere from 5 to 8 treatments from a pair of pads (you use two pads at a time for each channel|circuit). When finished just re-apply them to the sticker backing sheet they came with and reseal them in the envelope to extend the life of the pads.  I believe that this is a quality product and would not hesitate to recommend it. This device is inexpensive and practical but you should expect to buy more pads than the four that come with it."

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Yoli,63,44,"Great little unit. Very easy to use. Nice, clear, concise instructions. Purchased ear clips to use for vagal nerve stimulation. If you’re thinking about purchasing for this purpose, just know that ear clips will have to be manipulated to create one with positive and negative sides. First day of use, pain level 6/10. After use, 1/10! Energy level increased enough for me to be able to some activities. Mood level slightly elevated. Used unit 3xday. Second day, pain 3/10 before use. 0/10 after use. Energy level way up. Mood level was the best in about 10 years. Results just kept getting better. I’m not a doctor but I am a retired registered nurse who was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2008. I was at the end of my rope dealing with pain because I had tried all the medications used for fibro and had horrible side effects. Did not want to go down that road again. Read up on VNS and decided to try it. Lifesaving/changing. Not advocating for everyone to try this because there are some factors that might prevent individuals to use this type of treatment. Check with your doctor before trying this. Best buy I’ve ever made."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Andrey Koval,15,12," This is pretty amazing! I feel so much better when I hook up to TENS 7000 gives me immediate relief with the different settings and intensity of this device, my old unit had a power cord and was always a hassle to plus it in to use it, this divide is just as good with a battery, after using both, I prefer the one with batteries, less wires to deal with.  This is so powerful that I’m not able to go past the 3rd setting on the knobs, anything over 3 is way too much, my old one that’s a different brand wasn’t as powerful, so this is a big plus for people who have a lot of pain or Sciatica problems.  Highly recommend if you want real results, I’ve been having Sciatic problems for quite some time and this is the only thing that calms it down."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Amazon Customer,706,121,"I received my Tens 7000 yesterday, and was surprised it came with a secure hard case. I missed seeing that it came with the device, so it was a nice surprise.  I carefully read the instruction booklet this morning and decided to give it a try. I live on a farm and do all the chores, repairs, etc., on my own. As a result, I've done some lower back damage and wanted to see if this would help. I started out on low settings and changed the mode to see which would feel the best, and slowly increased the intensity to a comfortable, but therapeutic level. I set the onboard timer for 30 minutes, which shuts the device off automatically when done, but I sure could have kept it on much longer. The relief was amazing; but not wanting to overdo it, I'll wait until tomorrow for my next session...and truthfully, I can't wait.  I would advise anyone who buys this, not to be foolish and bypass reading the instruction booklet. There are serious warnings regarding what NOT TO DO and why."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Sam_FL,283,89,"Have been using it since October 1st. for vagus nerve stimulation , 2xday, 15 min. . Low battery indicator today, so it lasted 40 days and I am still using the same electrode- I only need one for VNS. I was removing battery after each session. Keep in mind, I was using one lead wire, in normal mode, 200/20. It most certainly uses more battery power if you use it for pain, since you use 2 lead wires and all 4 electrodes and in higher mode. Results: it does calm me down during sessions and the first week after I started using it, my sleep was much better, I even slept one night until 4am without awakening every hour or so. I had a sleep study and my sleep index was 37% (85% and higher is a must) with all kind of things happening along with frequent awakening- central apneas ( don’t confuse with obstructive apnea), CNS activation-HR going up to 150. So I can’t make my verdict yet, but it does help to fall asleep fast if you I it at bedtime, I don’t wake up too many times as before, but overall the results are inconsistent. I have POTS, so far it has no effect on my standing HR, or may be it is subtle, hard to tell since I take atenolol every morning."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Jamie Senecal,138,83,"Regrettably I I purchased this because of the low price point, the nice looking package, and many of the favorable reviews on Amazon. During the 3 months that the unit worked, the batteries needed to be changed about every three weeks. I don’t have a problem with that because the unit was used on a daily basis, As is recommended for chronic pain. Last week the unit stopped working altogether. Almost exactly 3 months to the day. Nothing could be done to revive it. And to make matters worse it was a gift to my father-in-law who lives in Thailand. Like many of the elders in Thailand he suffers from severe back disorders. This change unit was an absolute godsend. I was disappointed and heartbroken after finding out last night the unit is completely dead. They even brought it to a local electronics repair facility with out any luck of reviving the unit. Having just returned from Thailand three months ago I do not plan on returning until the fall. I am not going to let my father-in-law suffer until my opportunity to return with a new, better, and Different brand of unit. So I have this self imposed task of finding a replacement unit from a company that will deliver it to Thailand for a reasonable delivery fee. My guess is if you use this unit very in frequently it may be a good answer for you. But if you plan on using it to treat chronic pain, I implore you not Allow the low price and nice packaging deceive you as it did me"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Rob,103,66,"disclaimer: I received free 9v batteries from my old job where they were frequently disposed-of with half their life remaining!  I'm wearing the unit now and typing this glowing review. Earlier today, I could barely walk. Now I'm contemplating doing some outdoor chores. The biggest problem with this unit is that I keep forgetting to USE IT. You probably need to *try* a tens machine at a chiro or P.T. office before buying one. It is a bizarre sensation and has a particular process, but if you like TENS, then this one is a good one. This TENS machine is an awesome little TENS machine. It has good features if you want to mess with the settings and it has good presets if you don't want to mess with the settings. The little case that it comes with is really great and was an unexpected surprise. Its a micro plastic briefcase that is just big enough. The device is built like a quality transistor radio (if you're old enough to know what that is :) I've had TENS therapy in a dozen professional setting (chiro and P.T.) with perhaps 30 different people applying the electrodes and such. This machine and its results are as good as anything I've ever experienced. I considered buying a plug-in version, but anything other than the portable would be a huge mistake... just a silly, unnecessary restriction (though you wouldn't have to worry about batteries). I could imagine having to buy a 9v battery every couple weeks if I used it more regularly. If my back were completely out, one battery would probably get me back on my feet at least 4 times if I really pummeled myself with electricity (like I'm doing right now, as I type, and it feels awesome).  When this puppy breaks. Maybe when the inexpensive components finally wear out or I've dropped it a few dozen times too many, then I'll buy the same item again. Quality. Durability. Nicely thought-out. Carrying case. I can't remember if the instructions were any good. I just watched some youtube videos for pad placement ideas and turned up the dials (start slow, ok?) till the tingle started. oh... and the price. Did you think you were going to get something well-reviewed for much cheaper than thirty three bucks with free shipping? Prob not. Be glad you found this one!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Migraine Girl,662,72,"This unit packs a punch. It was such a lifesaver before I had a double knee replacement. I have also used it on my back and neck when I'd feel a migraine coming on. I would hook it up to both knees while standing all day at work, and subtly turn it off and on throughout the day as needed. It helped me get through the day better than prescription pain killers. Sometimes I would assume I had it up all the way because it was the maximum I could tolerate, only to find it wasn't even half way to full power. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the jacks. I've seen a few reviews that claimed it stopped working, and I would bet it is for the same reason. I admit, I carried this thing on my waistband or in my pocket for months. Sometimes it would fall off my waistband or out of my pocket only to be holding on by just the wires. These jacks are obviously not meant for the amount of strain I was putting on them. Imagine my extreme shock (literally) when I would be reaching into my pocket, slowly cranking up the juice, when all of a sudden the jack would connect again with the power on max. Some of my coworkers (and customers) thought I was being brutally attacked by an invisible being. I mean, essentially I was... Now the only way to make it work is by applying constant pressure to the jacks while in use. I've tried taking it apart to solder the jack connections, but it appears I'd have to break some of the housing to get in there. They obviously made this thing with the intention that consumer will never take it apart. Probably smart. So now I must decide whether to buy the same little machine for at home use (I won't need it at work in my pocket anymore), or buy some smaller digital unit that has the convenience of a rechargeable battery, but that I might find disappointing in comparison... So, I would say I highly recommend this product, just be aware the jacks are not meant for hardcore rough housing in a pocket or waistband on a daily basis. Update: I bought a different unit that was smaller and rechargeable. It had great reviews, etc... Just tried it and I'm sorry. It is not the same as this unit. Even with the power all the way up, it did not have the power and intensity that this product has. I could never turn my TENS 7000 up past half way. Plus the other item was more expensive, and the modes were confusing and reduntant. I just wanted it to be on with no fancy stuff, but that is apparently not an option with that unit. This product has some nice basic modes that are easy to understand and have a professional grade intensity that someone with real pain needs to get through. This unit is more... ""prescription strength"" whereas the product Im returning seems more over the counter generic. It's not as sexy as the other TENS units, but I'm ordering another one right now. With the intention of being nicer to the jacks this time!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,A Grandmother,162,141,"The therapist at physical therapy told me about Tens 7000.

I use this muscle stimulator once or twice a day for 20 minutes early h time and am still using the same adhesive pads. The battery that came with it lasted just a few days but the replacement Duracell battery is still working after two weeks. I have arthritis in my knees and hips and this little apparatus helps. Sometimes I wear it while I'm doing housework; there is a clip on the back that will slip over my waistband of slip into a pocket.

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,LabRat,217,41,"Oddly, one of the few TENS units out there with a simple, uninterrupted continuous mode with no ramping up, down or pulsing. It has a few of those too - 5 modes in all - but this is the feature I am used to at the chiropractor/physical therapist. I like the plug in electrodes better than snap on, and like the simple controls - one rotary knob for each channel and three buttons for mode/up/down select. My small complaint is that the rotary knobs are partially recessed in the housing making it hard to get my big fingers around them to turn. But I've used the original 9v battery for the first six or seven 12-minute sessions with no signs of running down. There are four 2"" square electrodes that are just right for most uses and though the instructions don't mention cleaning or moistening them I use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub them off with water between uses to keep the adhesive active. The pain from my back spasm is finally going away since I began using this and I consider this the best value for the $ out there. Strong buy!"

I've been researching more 2x2 pads and placed an order for iStem brand. My plan is to use this miracle machine every night to rehab my shoulder. I have the dials set to 2.5 and it does a wonderful job. I read a review to put it on the edge of pain area and not directly on it. The device is small and lightweight about the size of a man's wallet. The case is perfectly cushioned for traveling and had it in my check-in bag today. I did get the 2-year warranty for $4 to be on the safe side. I'll return to MMA training in 4 days and will see how well this helps. Today I was rock climbing and shooting hoops; my shoulder was not giving me any issues. I'll keep y'all updated on my progress.  Update 10/10: It's been about 3 weeks and this magic device help heal my shoulder. I now have another injury to use this on; my knee. I'm still using the original pads and they're still sticky. I'm certain its because I clean my skin with rubbing alcohol before applying the pads."

After an ER visit for sciatica pain so intense I wanted to scream and tear my own leg muscles out, I was sent home with 5 pain pills and the suggestion to follow up with my primary. These were low dose and didn't change my pain levels and only made me drowsy. To say the system failed me wouldn't do justice.  Anyone experiencing *actual* pain knows that it feels like life or death. Because who wants to live without sleep in cksntsnt waking pain?? No one. I've never experienced any pain like this back pain / sciatica. All from moving a few seemingly lightweight storage bins.  I've gotten to the point where IB profin wasn't working and I was searching for help 3 hours after taking my meds. 8 hours of sleep was out of the question. Desperate to help myself because no one else would, I of course came to Amazon to search for leer reviews and came across this TENs machine. THANK GOODNESS. My whole life has been a nightmare lately.

Now as mentioned this does not cure you but it helps subside the pain and for the first time in a long time I could stand up after sleeping and not since for 15 minutes while trying to lower my leg. This is the real deal! I wanted to add my experience here because I know how important reviews are to me.  You do have to spend a bit of time reading the directions but after that it's simple. SO glad I bought this instead of the nerve cream, though I may try that as a little extra soemthinf down the line. Hopefully I won't need to. I use between a 4-5 when it's bad but as others have mentioned, 3 is pretty good for most things. I can't feel 1 and 2 is a slight tingle. THANK YOU SO MUCH"

Thankful and grateful Yes. I am willing to be charged. Have been in hospital and had no one to help me. Its ok. I apologize unforeseen situation.

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Jessica S.,34,66,"I used to work for a chiropractic clinic years ago. We used these types of unit. This Tens 7000 is as intense as the big units we used on ourselves and patients. It took a little bit of adjusting and figuring out the different modes on this one. I was literally shocked by a jolt because I cranked it up to high at first, totally my fault. I starrted speaking in tongues before I turned it down. It definitely caught me by surprise. This is definitely a powerful little unit. Let me just say ""IT FEELS AMAZING"" I pull muscles and hurt my back and neck frequently so having this wonderful. I have an old car accident injury that gives me grief also. I remember selling these from the clinic I worked in years ago. Several hundreds to purchase one. I highly recommend this electrical stimulation machine for pain. It's a life saver. This has always helped my pain.. i am thrilled to have it!!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Irene P. Kittrell,333,91,"I've had the TENS 7000 for two days and love it. I'm using it to stimulate the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nervous system. I bought the black ear clips from Amazon to attach to the concha portion of the outer ear. Settings I'm using are: Normal mode; Pulse 200 microseconds, Rate 30 Hz and 20 minutes on the timer. These settings were suggested by a chiropractor on his website. He suggested putting the square electrode pad on the left upper shoulder over the trapezius muscle and the black ear clip (attached to red wire) on the left ear. Other sources warn against putting the electrodes on the right side because the vagus nerve affects cardiac function on that side. This device works for me. The treatments leave me feeling deeply relaxed. If it begins to malfunction, I'll order another one."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,M. Foxworth,9,12,"I bought this TENS unit in 2018 for my wife who had always had problems with back pain and headaches. But I did not understand what pain was and did not understand how the TENS could possibly help her. So, I never tried to get her to use it. Fast Forward a few years and a personal trainer suggested she use it. Talk about taking the horse to water but not getting it to drink. I wish I was half as smart as I sometimes think I am. Since then, I've studied the work of Dr. Lorimer Moseley (see his book Explain Pain or his many YouTube videos) and Dr. David Clarke (see his book ""They Can't Find Anything Wrong"") and looked deeply into the dominance of chronic pain in so many other settings. Such as Peripheral Neuropathy. Or back pain. Or migraine. And the function of pain in little things like insect bite and itch. So, she started using it. It always helps. - For headache (Hey! She's married to me! Talk about grounds for headache.) - After overstressing her back (she had a serious injury in late 1970s). - After overstressing her rotator cuff tendons (not as strong as they used to be). - For calming down after insect bites (mosquitoes and biting flies love her) Why does it work? Because none of these painful conditions are truly dangerous. Pain is something our brain creates when it thinks we are in danger and should do something. The more one puts focus on that source of pain (in her case, headache, backache, muscle/tendon ache, itch and insect bump) the deeper the distress. So, what does the TENS do? The brain can only focus on one source of stress at time. The TENS adds another minor harmless stimulus that distracts the brain away from the initial issue. After a little while, resting and relaxing, my wife emerges with the focus moved to more important things. Like lunch. Eventually the old TENS unit died and I got another."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,LuckyMacaw1977,9,19,"Hello Everyone. I am a grappler, I've been training jiujitsu for the last 10 years. People sometimes refer it to the gentle art, but gentle is not. Needless to say I grapple/wrestle people my weight, or 200lbs heavier than me, so my body goes through quite some wear. Last week I sprained my knee, injured my mcl like I've done in the past a few times. A friend of mine said this machine Tens 7000, really helped her recover, I got the link and it was only $28 bucks, with that price, I figure why not, give it a try. The machine takes a 9 volt battery that is included, not sure how long these batteries have been in the case but my only lasted about 4 treatments which run for 30 minutes each. So to be safe buy another 9v battery at your local dollar store to have a spare. Super simple to run it, and it has given me excellent results. I marked the 2 pads that I am using with a marker so I only use the same pads every time I do a treatment. At this time, I think I am running my 20th treatment with the same 2 pads and they are still very sticky. To apply extra pressure I usually wrap my knee over the pads this really does make the bond tighter and you feel the difference. As far as the levels, there are 8 levels and the highest I've been able to tolerate is a 3. So if you're thinking 8 levels are not strong enough for you, I invite you to give this a chance, the number and intensity are very deceiving. Overall I am super happy with this unit, and have already recommended to all my friends."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Marinchich,1092,141,"There's nothing I don't like about this product. It gives not just temporary relief but actually helps to recover. For yrs I'm suffering all sorts of pains and aches, as a consequence of my work. I'm a nanny, I carry, play and struggle with the kids, and not a day passes by that I don't feel sore muscles or pinched nerve, sprains, and despite workouts nothing helped. I gave up any pills because Advil and similar medications would only mask pain, causing stomach issues.  I was looking for a solution that doesn't include medication. I asked my physician over the phone, but they wouldn't share any info until I come and pay for the checkup. So I ran my own research, based on that I'm feeling lots of pain and discomfort as people having fibromyalgia. One of the articles mentioned TENS unit. I found it on Amazon and the price was very decent.  On the first day upon arrival, I patched the most painful spots on my back and shoulders. The next day they were a bit puffy but I could move easier. But using TENS every day, the way body needs, changed the quality of my life!!! The aches are going away and do not come back. I'm not stiff, sudden move doesn't cause pinching feelings or so.  All I can say I wish I knew about this device before, would save me years of pain. Also, as my pain is healing, now I'm more sure I'm not suffering any serious condition, it's just everyday muscle and body moves that eventually made me achy and stiff all the time. I feel so normal again!!!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Chris Fogarty,603,100,"This TENS 7000 apparatus greatly eased my wife's excruciating back pain. Until, at a friend's urging, we bought this product via Amazon, I had to give my wife 20-minute-long massages each hour around the clock. It turned out that she continues to use the product rarely; only upon flares-up of lumbar-disc related lower back pain.  We are so grateful that this product exists. We gave to a suffering friend the extra system we bought for back-up. My wife is so afraid of a possible malfunction of our TENS 7000 system that we bought another back-up system to replace the one we gave to the friend.  The excruciating pain ended upon her ceasing to use Statins for cholesterol. Her doctor did not discover the problem. It was in conversations with her sister in England that she learned that the pain was Statin-based. She still uses the TENS 7000 occasionally to relieve less-intense pain from a lumbar disc problem.  Before she learned that the excruciating pain was Statin-caused, two sets of doctors were suggesting psychiatry for her."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Sharreldine B.,520,91,"I am a firm believer in chiropractic care, which is how I learned about muscle stimulation units like this. Not only am I a lifetime chiropractic patient due to genetic conditions in my back, but I actually worked for one for a while, and have family that still works there, and am really good friends with the family of chiropractors that owns that business. Years ago, my sister bought this unit, and we take it with us everywhere. We take it on vacations, road trips, and it gets used here at home at least twice a week, bare minimum. My best friend's husband has back pain, and... We just can't convince him to actually go to the chiropractor, lol. So for Christmas I decided to get him this. So far, as far as I know, they like it. I thought it was interesting to know that my sister bought this years ago, and it is the exact same unit that I purchased for my friend. So... This little unit stands the test of time. The only real difference after having this for several years is that now the back battery cover keeps popping off, so I Just use a bit of tape to hold it on. Now literally as far as how this works, this works as good as the one's that we used in the chiropractor's office, if not better - I'm not kidding. I feel like this has more strength than those do, and it is certainly more portable. It uses 9-volt batteries, I usually order them in bulk from Amazon along with refill electrode pads. The pads will wear out after a while. You can spray them with a mist of water when you are done using them to re-stick them to the plastic backing, that will help them last a little longer. You can still get a good 30 to 40 uses out of them though. I use this on everything. I primarily use it on my lower back, because that is my specific problem. But you can also put it on your thighs, your calf muscles, recently I used it on a swollen ankle that I somehow sprained. Any place that you have muscles you can use it. I have even carefully used it on the lower sides of my jaw, helping with my eustachian tubes being swollen due to allergies. I also know the chiropractor has used it on jaws to help with lockjaw. But there are so many varieties of uses, you can Google all sorts of places and things that can help with and where to put the electrodes to help with certain specific things. But it's a really good unit, super worth the money, and holds up with the test of time - obviously, there's not a upgraded unit. This is the exact same one! Just always make sure that you turn it off before removing the stickies, and make sure that when you are done using it you always turn the dials down till they click off. Enjoy You won't regret it!"

I find the painful nerves and put the electrodes on the areas of pain. It works well and the pain subsidies after using the machine for about a weak. It is powered by a 9v battery which lasts a long time. The battery provided with the machine runs out of juice too quickly. I replaced it with Amazon batteries and they last through a large number of uses. You can, of course, choose whatever batteries you like.  There is one con and that is the 2 channel system does not work independently.  I recommend this unit---check with your doctor first."

If you live with chronic back pain and can't take it any longer...buy this little guy and at least have some measure of momentary pain relief!  I've used TENS devices over the years.

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Cheryl H.,154,30,"I am not generally a person to do many reviews, but this TENS unit deserves high praise! Yes, the picture I shared is of my arm, but that’s after I used it on my back, which is why I purchased it. I hurt my back/pulled a muscle pretty badly A week ago at OTF. It was recommended to me after class, and I purchased it that day and received it the next day. Sadly, I tried to stay on top of it with ice and heat and Advil throughout the week, and it would get better, get worse, get better and cycle that way. I even had a salonpas and one Robaxin that I could have used, but I try my hardest to not use much medication and was taking enough Advil. Last night I finally took the time to learn about the unit and use it. It was so easy, the electrode patches adhere beautifully and the unit is exceptionally easy to use and you can keep busy while wearing it since it clips to your clothing. I literally don’t change any settings unless it is The length of time. I have used it now in several places, but after 30 minutes on my back last night, it was probably 85% improved and remains that way today! It may in fact be even better. I still took the day off from OTF just to be safe as I don’t want to hurt it again. I highly highly highly recommend this unit!"

DO NOT open the dial case/power level, unless you have finished your original setting/program. I was smack in the middle of a therapy session and was going to turn it off early and accidentally moved the dial the other way. I was hit sooo hard with an electric shock i had no idea that was even possible, as it's battery operated. I was left with sore shoulders, a sore neck and a headache for days. All in all love this machine and the case is super helpful, but just be careful please!!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Tony,55,45,"i've been procrastinating to make a physio appointment to relieve pain I have in my right elbow so i decided to buy this product because of all the positive reviews and of course it's low price. I was not expecting much but it did not disappoint. it's got several pulse modes and a max intensity of 8 but I can only endure up to 3 or 4 as any higher results in electrocution. I also bought some extra rechargeable 9v batteries as some reviewers mentioned that the battery does drain frequently. so far have used the unit 3 times and the supplied TENS battery is still going strong. The only negative aspect of the unit is that it is not backlit but its not a deal breaker as its a set it and forget it. Once your 30 minutes are up, it beeps and the show is over. I like that it has a belt clip so I can haul it with me and not have to hold it or put it in my pocket. The adhesive patches are still sticking after 3 sessions. Looks like they will stick for awhile longer. the plastic carrying case is very flimsy but still a good option if you travel a lot. This TENS appliance is probably the biggest bang for your buck."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,i_luv_dogs,577,52,"Been suffering from excruciating sciatica leg pain and this little unit is by the far, the most effective pain relieving device I've found. It feels exactly like the ones used by chiropractors and acupuncturists , even though it is so small. Because my pain is in the back of my thighs, it's been painful to sit but the TENS unit provides enough relief that I am able to sit and work at my desk. Sometimes, I apply the pads, turn it on and let it run while I sit and work.  Set up is easy though the explanations of the different modes could be a lot better. I’ve only really used it in normal mode as I am not sure what the others do. So far, I am using it many times a day as needed. That said, 4 pads isn't a lot, and I've thought of purchasing another one so I can add 4 more areas to be treated. I've also read the reviews of how it can die suddenly and prematurely, so again, I plan to order a second one in case that happens. While it is unfortunate that the unit can just die in a couple of months, it is still relatively inexpensive and costs less than a session with a chiropractor or acupuncturist, so that’s how I see it.  Not sure when I’ll need to replace the pads but I think as long as you stick them back on the clear plastic it came with, they should last a while. I do find they don’’t stick as well if you’ve applied cream or lotion on the skin before. Also, someone mentioned getting zapped in a review - I suspect that was caused by a pad coming loose and if that falls on your skin, it can feel like you are getting zapped."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Amazon Customer,20,1,"OMG!!! If I could give this more stars I would. I have been suffering with Sciatic pain for over 5 months now. I have tried chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture as well as numerous rub on products. Over $800 total with very little relief. I put this $30 unit to use as soon as I got it out of the box and within an hour I was almost pain free. I was able to cook a meal from scratch and clean up after myself. I had my best nights sleep in months and was able to shower with out tears. Don't be wary of the price. Sometimes you get more than what you pay for :) If you are wary of the price just think of all the money you are throwing away on all the other remedies that haven't worked.

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,LeeZ06,136,50,"I recently injured my back and after several months of little progress toward getting better, I decided to try TENS therapy. I have been using this unit for a few weeks now and it does help. My wife also injured her back while gardening and liked what my TENS machine did for her back, so I ordered one for her too! If you're wondering what TENS is and what it feels like, it's like a very deep massage that is unrelenting and targeted. I've never used TENS for any injury other than back pain, but I wouldn't hesitate to use TENS and I would likely get this same unit. It's very convenient and easy to use. You can move around while getting treatment, but I wouldn't try any activities that would work up a serious sweat, because that might cause the pads to come loose. Considering cost of any of the other therapies I had before this TENS unit (doctor visits, drugs, physical therapy), I would consider this unit a absolute steal! Very happy."

This unit has been on an airplane, camping, and several overnight travels and road trips. It has performed flawlessly and delivered therapy consistently since day one. I've just ordered my 3rd extra kit of pads as the first two kits have worked very well.  This unit is stout and has continued to work inside and outside the home when needed. I use this at least once per day in conjunction with an ice pack after my homework physical therapy. There are multiple days that only the tens unit will subside the pain. This is not a cure and only a temporary relief but it is very much worth the short reprieve from pain.  Proper physical therapy should be followed during treatment. This unit is not a cure for pain, it's a temporary solution to be followed in conjunction with PT treatment."

Once cooled, I tried again and the unit would not power on. 8/16/17 contacted the 1-800 number in the instruction manual, and spoke with technical support. Another unit is being shipped and I can return the unit I have. I was emailed a UPS label to use so there will be no cost to me for returning this unit. I am pleased with the customer support. Hopefully, my issue was an isolated one. The unit is compact, and easy to use. I love the timing feature and the different settings. Will update after new unit is received and used for a bit.  8/22/17 - Update - received the replacement unit on 8/21/17. So I am very happy with the Customer Service for the product.

It's probably way more machine than what I need. I just use the standard TENS setting, and it works. The pinching and cramping disappear. Depending on the day, one 30 minute session may be all I need. For me, the pain will sometimes return 15-20 minutes after it shuts off. But other days, it stays gone.  The unit is well-made, is lightweight, and it's pretty easy to put the pads on myself.  Definitely recommended. Although, I do understand not all people will be helped by a TENS unit."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Patricia D,420,350,"I own three other Tens sets, one that came from a medical supply source years ago that is awesome but takes a LOT of batteries and burns through them fast and two others more recent types, including one that is listed as Amazon’s choice. Those two are Meh at best. This one blows them out of the water!  Do be very careful to set the dials VERY low first and move them up super gradually. My shoulders can only take about a three. I accidentally bumped the dial way higher and thought I wasn’t going to be able to get to the dial to shut it off. I don’t know how anyone could set them at max.  This has the oomph I need, though I should probably invest in rechargeable 9 volt batteries now (takes one).  The clip is great, too. It makes the device truly wearable!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,S Thrower,191,71,"Chiropractor suggested I get a TENS unit for home since the one at his office gives me such great relief for low back pain. I read the reviews and saw that this one has a big fan base, so I ordered it. Great choice! The unit is easy to operate, and uses only one 9v battery. I had suspicions that it would be a weak electrical current in comparison to the $900, ''industrial grade'' TENS unit that my chiropractor uses, but this thing packs a wallop (a good wallop). There are multiple settings from which to choose, so you have a vast array of possibilities for pain relief. Chiropractor suggested using a TENS unit along with ice, simultaneously, for optimal relief (put a cloth barrier between your skin and the ice) and he was RIGHT. I love this thing! Great! Great! Hugs to the manufacturer and the previous positive reviews for helping me make a great purchase decision."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Hayden,136,50,"I ordered my TENS Unit on here back in October of 2015. It has lasted me with absolutely no issues this entire time. It still works to this day. I’m not really sure if there was a faulty batch or just operator error from those who said it stopped working after a few months.  This is a powerful little electrode machine thing. It has helped me so much over the years from the various injuries I’ve sustained, particularly with back and neck pain I’ve had that I could seemingly not find relief from with more “conventional” methods.  The original little 2x2 pads it comes with adhere very well. Unfortunately, the replacements I got for them were ordered from a knock-off brand some I’m saddled with those until they run out and I can buy the correct ones. So be wary that you get the right brand or you’ll be stuck with janky, non-adherent sticky pads.  Overall, recommend to anyone with any kind of muscle pains. It’s very simple and easy to use - any age group should be able to use it without trouble (the tiny knobs on top MIGHT be difficult for those with severe arthritis)."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Pat Patterson,2913,793,"Let me get the (very mild) negatives out of the way first: 1. The 9 volt battery that ships with the unit is only good for about a day. Do yourself a favor, and get a four-pack of rechargeable 9 batteries and a charger when you place your order. That gives you one in the unit, one in the storage hole in the case, and two in the recharger. 2. The gooey adhesive that sticks the electrodes on your skin will come loose if you sweat a lot, as I do in the Georgia summer heat. They sell replacements, BUT that gooey patch is ALWAYS going to come off. Fortunately, with the help of my physical therapist, I came up with a cheap, easy fix. 3. This will NOT permanently take your pain away! If you think ANYTHING will, you are mistaken.  HOWEVER: (And these are the VERY good points) 1. This unit absolutely WILL interrupt the pain-feedback cycle for some types of pain! I have some degenerating discs and a chronic pain condition, been under the treatment of specialists for just over 15 years now. Even massive doses of opioids won't take some pain away. I developed some pain in my hip that ran down my leg, and it was keeping me from sleeping at night. I would have to take an entire day's supply of NORCO to sleep, leaving nothing for the day. My physical therapist showed me how to break the pain cycle with a hand massager, but the good one cost $300. We gave this a try, and IT WORKS. I can wear this outside, and have; you just have to run the tires so not to snag. 2. A few minutes of the unit breaks my pain cycle, and I'm good for anywhere from half an hour to more than an hour. If you don't live with chronic pain you won't understand how lovely that is! 3. There are TENS belts for sale, but nothing really looked right to me, and they were kind of pricey. Kendra, my physical therapist suggested using an ACE bandage to hold the electrodes on. I took that idea, and expanded on it. In the picture, you see the two black electrodes on the left? They are more-or-less permanently attached to the ACE bandage, AND it's a work in progress. I sewed the edges of the patches to the bandage at first, but found I hadn't allowed for the stretch, and the placement of the patches was too far off. I was working out in my shed at the time, and just used what was handy, which was some wire. I suggest you experiment with some small safety pins. I call the result my Kendra Belt, in her honor.  With a little fiddling, I can place the patches where they will work, and I just tie the bandage around my waist or shoulder. NOTE: there are some places on my back that it's really hard to get the patches on, because of the way I'm built, which is not a perfect cylinder, and I'm also furry. Perhaps some of the commercial belts do a better job.  If it's not easy, you won't use it, and I found positioning the pads not to be easy. The Kendra Belt is easy, and CHEAP! It rolls up, and stashes inside the hard carrying case the unit comes in."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Caleb E.,31,37,"I always read all the 1-star reviews and sometimes psych myself out from buying something. I went ahead and got this one for the price and majority good reviews. So I’ll say what some people like myself might want to know: -My reason for wanting this: Tight shoulder tendon issues, back pain, and help with muscle recovery after workouts -If you’ve never had one of these, don’t stress about the bad reviews. I have nothing to compare mine too, but excellent for my purposes. -Power is more than enough. I am a little sensitive, but this feels exactly the same strength as the one I was hooked up to at the chiropractor. -I actually strongly prefer the basic set up with no touch screen. The dial and buttons are well protected by the plastic cap so I don’t accidentally dial it up too much. -The adhesion is awesome. I also purchased some electrode gel on Amazon for roughly a dollar and some change to help, and I think it is well worth it. -You will eventually need more pads, which I also purchased additionally. I’m guessing maybe 10 uses with electrode gel before they don’t stick well anymore.  Overall, I can definitely feel the muscles spazzing and pain areas become more apparent, but not too uncomfortable while using. I have only used a few times so far, but it seems to be the same helpfulness as the one at the chiropractor. Very happy with my purchase and excellent price."

The pain comes from a bulging disc as well as a very cranky previously injured low back muscle that acts up on any pretext. I've tried Lidocaine patches, Pennsaid gel, Icy Hot, heating pads, exercise, Advil and Aleve. Results have not made a noticeable difference. This was the last resort before narcotics which I don't want. Then I put this machine on and I can actually walk through the grocery store without holding onto the cart for support. I don't have to sit down due to muscle spasms when I go from the living room to the kitchen. I'm walking normally without any pain. It's not a cure. But if it makes the pain go away so I can move again, I'm happy. I gave it four stars because I find setting it up a little confusing. Also, don't adjust the strength while you're wearing it. I accidentally turned it up too high and had to pull the wire out...FAST! It doesn't take much to work on me. It's like a gentle massage on level 2 and I can't express how happy I am with it. I'm satisfied with the quality and the results."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Christmas morning,91,38,"I think the best TENS out there. Has all the parameters and features you want and need: It has a cover over the dials that you turn to increase the electric current, this is important so when you walk around you don't unexpectedly bump the dial and turn it up, giving yourself a jolt. It has all the waveforms needed so you can switch around so your body doesn't adapt. It works on a 9V battery, which I find much for convenient than bothering with charging something. The pads that come with it are reusable. If your skin is clean and not too much hair I'd say you can expect 10-20 uses from each pad. You do NOT need to buy the electrical conductance gel that is sold separately, not needed and, actually adds to a mess on your clothes. I appreciate that this has a timer and will shut itself off after you've completed the treatment. These units used to cost more than $400 back in the day. Now 20 years later, as with all electronics, these units are so cheap; I think everyone should have one in their home so when a joint starts to hurt or your back hurts you can put this on it. It's a much better alternative to pharmaceuticals, which always have a side effect. No side effects here!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Bama,149,165,"Purchased this newer model because I couldn’t find my original (hiding from me). Had a first time and horrendous bout with sciatic pain. Used twice a day at first, then once daily. Unbelievably helpful! Great assist in restoring my mobility and reducing pain level. IMO, equally helpful as those used in physical therapy or chiropractic therapy. Always a good idea to see your doctor to rule out any deeper level physical issues, especially when vertebrae, joints, or pinched nerves may be involved."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Christina mullen,28,36,"It’s very strong ! When you turn it on go extremely slow with the knob until you find your desired strength. It starts out strong. I Was playing around with it before I decided to use it then forgot I had turned it on. Once I attached the second sticky piece and was trying to maneuver both pieces to my back one of them got stuck to my finger and my hand still hurts! I do need strong for my back pain not in my hand LOL. I wish you didn’t have To apply both patches in order to get the charge since it’s going on my back it’s a little difficult to get them put together and onto my back without them sticking to my hand etc. However once they’re stuck there very good about staying stuck. I love that there is a clasp to put it on my belt and put it on this side to take with Me throughout the day and no one knows it’s there. It has a heavy carry case for travel which is great because I won’t lose any of the components when I’m not using it. I don’t have to use both side A and side B At the same time which I like. If I needed to I could have two patches on my back from side A and two patches on my shoulder from side B. (both running with different programs) I have ordered tried and returned another tens unit. Same kind of set up with two sides. It wasn’t as durable, and it would switch randomly on every single one that I set it on so I would set it and like the way it felt and then suddenly it would switch and turn to a painful sensation at that level of strength. so I returned it. This unit stays on the sensation I switch it to and I love that. DOWNSIDE - It only comes with four patches so you need to order new patches With the unit. I wanted to try it first. The cover on the top and the phase of the unit could eventually come off so I have to be careful with that. The only big complaint I have is that the knobs are so small I have arthritis in my hands and it’s hard to get in there and adjust them easily. ***You need to turn it up very slowly because it’s very powerful! If you are a new tens unit user it’s probably best to start with A unit that is not this strong. Because these are very strong. (. I need this strength because I have 10 screws in my back and six in my neck from fusions. I have a Lotta nerve damage and muscle pain. Once you buy a tens unit you get used to the sensation eventually and it’s not as effective so I like that I only need to be at at two and it’s very strong so I can turn this up Quite a bit and change the different settings/sensations. Hope this helps"

I have a physiotherapist with her Ph.D in spine health who urged me to get this unit….especially since I cannot take OTC meds. Over time I developed a deadly anaphylaxis to NSAIDS, combined with bone density & safety issue of steroid use. I don’t know why it took me this long to get a unit for personal use. I am an active 60 year old. Age without degenerative/osteoarthritic changes is not a realistic expectation.

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,KHalstead,520,171,"This specific TENS unit was recommended by my Physical Therapist. It is very easy to use, and I love the fact it came with a case. There are units out there that cost a lot more but do the same as this one. I have horrific sciatic pain from a pinched nerve and this does help. It mostly distracts your mind from the pain, it doesn't take the pain away but that is what any TENS unit does and this was an excellent value for my money."

I have had internal scar tissue which has pressed on my patellar tendon for 5 months. Upon using this device, I have become virtually pain free in just 3 days and even the scar tissue has flattened. I now understand why NBA players can suffer a horrible ankle injury and come back to play in a few days. It has to be because of technology similar to this. It's amazing.  From my experience, make sure you find the right position and start very low. I only need it at 3 and it is plenty intense. But when I move it a few centimeters, it touches on some nerves and it feels very uncomfortable."

My therapist couldn’t get my neck to relax, I kept having neck spasms that traveled down my back. He asked me to try this at home a couple times a day for a week before coming back to see him. It was a little something to get use to but the pain relief I got from this tens unit was incredible. When I returned to my therapist, we were able to move forward through the rest of my six weeks of therapy! I now use it only when I need some good relief (after working in the garden all morning or lawn stuff). I won’t be without this tens unit. It has changed my life for the better."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,John F. Wittmann,126,48,I’ve been using this product for 6 years now and it has never failed me. I get occasional upper back spasms from major shoulder surgeries and this unit calms down the knots that form in the muscles. I highly recommend purchasing this compact machine because it works and feels just like the ones at physical rehab facilities. I’d also recommend purchasing additional pads because the adhesive will eventually wear out.
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Danny boy,11,34,"I would have given it 5 stars but I haven't had the unit that long but it has been great. I've had lower back problems and spasms for many years and this unit surprised me. Yes, I've cranked it numerous times to really stimulate my back and you have to be careful doing that. But my back has gone from a 2 to a 7 in not much time and I will continue to use the Tens all the time. Load up on the pads and 9 volt batteries!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,AZgal,363,182,"I bought this unit for pain relief and to use in conjunction with exercises that my PT gave me after fracturing my tibia. Instructions are moderately clear (I brought it to a PT appointment and was better instructed in its use there). Electrodes have great adhesion and I have been able to use 2 of the 4 that come with the unit for a full week of daily use with continued good adhesion (I haven’t needed to use the other 2 yet). When used appropriately, pain relief was better than average. Great results when using in conjunction with exercises on SD mode- to help stimulate the muscle to get better contraction. Probably best in early stages of recovery when those muscles have been significantly reconditioned. Very good price for what you get in a handy carrying case (unit, 4 electrodes, 2 leads with 2 electrode wires each). I purchased an additional set of electrodes for future use as I can see that it may be helpful for bodily aches and pains."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Captain Al,10,19,"I have recurring back spasms. Had been taking lots of prescriptions, tizadadine, etc. and ibuprofen, acetaminophen. They helped but it would be a week or more before the pain would stop. The Tens unit gives instantaneous relief. And as soon as the pain restarts, I just turn on the tens unit. And I can go anywhere with it. It is a life saver. This unit is excellent. If had it for several years and it still works flawlessly. I’d recommend getting rechargeable 9 volt batteries, and extra pads and wires. My only negative comment is that after the stimulation times out, u have to turn it off and then turn the knob back to the stimulation setting u like. It would be much nicer if there was simply a reset button so it started up at the previous settings. But overall, it’s far better than the alternatives. Buy it, u won’t regret the purchase!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,JOSE CAVAZOS,60,39,Ok so my Sciatic nerve started acting up again and I remembered the chiropractor used one of these on me. Let me tell you. I am amazed for the price this is an amazing little machine. It's small and compact and very powerful and super easy to use. It comes with 4 electrodes - very sticky you need 2 for each channel. This little thing comes with 2 channels. It's basically plug and play. I literally had this on me within 5 minutes of opening the package. I didn't know that the 9volt battery that's included did so much. You will definitely not be disappointed with this product.
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Nermal,419,41,"Finally. Finally.  I was able to find a ""normal"" TENS unit.  Like the kind they have at the PT office or a Chiropractic clinic. Why was this so hard? I purchased and returned two other much more expensive devices before I found this one. In fact, I could get 4 of these tens units for the price of the two I just returned.  What I wanted:  1. Steady tens contraction without any cute pre-programmed electrocution-by-Morse-Code nonsense.  2. I did not it want a rechargeable unit because didn't want to wait around on a rechargeable battery when I'm in pain  What I like about this TENS: This unit has plain and steady current, allows you to adjust the intensity and frequency of the current and has a few other settings that I enjoy. I really like the sin wave function. Most importantly, you can get steady current.  Con: the packaging is a little bulky. They use little industrial science packaging breifcases instead of custom soft cases, but I assume that keeps the costs low. Not enough to loose a star. This little guy outperformed a $100 unit, who cares if the case is too big."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,ladybugz820,76,38,"This thing is amazing!! Starting around March 2019, I started having horrible debilitating lower back pain suddenly, and completely out of the blue. After many months of suffering, I finally was diagnosed with degenerative disc disorder, and 2 herniated lumbar discs: L4 and L5. Multiple prescriptions, Toradol and morphine shots, and an epidural injection later, all with very little pain relief, I was giving up hope. Then I got this after experiencing one for the first time at a physical therapy session. It honestly helps so much. I ended up with 2 disc extrusions: One being a huge one pushing my sciatic nerve 14 mm out of place, which caused literally the worst pain I've ever felt in my life (and I had my one child without pain medication) down my left leg. This didn't help for that, unfortunately. But nothing did except surgery. Now that I'm recovered from surgery, I still get back pain occasionally and still use the TENS rather than my prescription pain medications. I'm still amazed that something so inexpensive has helped more than narcotic pain medication!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Juice Inla,139,75,"These work very well. My tens unit has changed my live- in Jan 2018, a chiropractor injured my occipital nerve. Nothing short of traction and this tens unit provided relief (Ice packs and cortisone shots also provided temp relief) I spent 11 months in so much pain, there were times I didn’t want to live. Most days the temp relief from the Tens7000 unit was the only thing keeping me from breaking down completely. Now I use it for other issues- usually muscle strain or exercise injuries- and I love it. Is GREAT for tension headaches - if you are carrying all your tension in those shoulders.  One word of caution. I had a physical therapist who used these on me years ago, and so I knew not to turn it it up too high right away, and has been instructed on placement. In other words, I had professionals teaching me how to use before I tried on my own.  IMPORTANT!!!! please know that of the unit is on, even at a low setting like 1-2, and you place the pad on an area with lots of nerves- like touching your finger tips to the side of an active pad- it will feel like a shock! Correct pad placement before turning unit on is CRITICAL!!! This is true of any tens unit, not a flaw of this one.  Longevity: I bought in 2018 and it’s August 2019, and my unit works perfectly, after months of heavy use. Have bought replacement pads. I bought the brand name, didn’t want to risk buying inferior products."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,D. Drummond,825,205,"They used to use a less portable one of these at a chiropractor I was going to. I always liked the treatment, and wished I could have it more often. That Chiropractor closed his business during the pandemic so I found a new one and they were using these. They were also selling them for $150! Of course being an avid Amazon shopper, I checked here and found them, and got one. It's so nice to be able to use one any time I have a shoulder knot and not have to wait to get a massage or go to the chiro. Be sure to order some extra pads. Depending on your skin, they may not want to stick after 2 or 3 uses, and if you don't get good adhesion you might get a nasty surprise zinger, so make sure they are stuck down good."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Denise,49,70,"I read in other reviews that their unit stopped working after 3.5 months. It was probably the pads but nothing wrong with unit if you replace them. Mine eats up batteries but it’s because I use it so much. I’ve bought them for friends with back pain mine works so well. I’ve had 17 surgical procedures on the nerves I’m my back. I get pain shooting down arms and legs. This works for both. I’m using it on the heel and arch of my feet now. If yours is not working or now powerful enough, change battery and/or pads. It makes a huge difference. I’ve used several brands of pads and fir those I look at reviews."

Features a metal belt clip, and a really really simple mode selection that can be easily modified to create a very custom stim session. Love that this has a nice storage case and uses 9volt batteries too. The only downside is it doesn’t have a port for an A/C power adapter. Love this new device!!!  PS - One gripe I have and it’s a small one, the display is not illuminated, so there has to be some ambient light in order to see the display."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Emma,0,4,"So I bought this to replace another TENS unit. The number of modes is the only thing that feels like a downgrade (this unit has 5). Don’t let the pulse rate or pulse width settings hold you back from buying this unit, because the instruction manual does a great job explaining everything. I really like how I don’t have to use both channels/4 electrodes all at once. Surprisingly this unit doesn’t sense when an electrode is no longer stuck to skin, so if one starts to unstick while it’s operating, it won’t turn off. So you’ll get that uncomfortable prickly sensation. But the power of this unit… it’s exponentially more powerful than any other unit I’ve used, ever. I can’t imagine how or why this can be cranked up to a 10, unless you’re a straight up m*sochist. Like I usually use this unit for severe migraine/tension headaches, and I can’t turn it any higher than ~4-5 without it getting uncomfortable. I was in the ER recently for kidney stones, truly the most painful physical thing I’ve ever gone through, and I used this nonstop while they made me wait for pain meds. Any attempts to turn it past 6 would start to hurt more than help. So if anyone buys this and then says it’s not powerful enough… you might have bigger problems lol."

I typically alternate ice and a heating pad in attempt to soothe them, but nothing was truly working. This thing has worked miracles for me and I am insanely grateful. Prior to using this, my knots were so bad I couldn’t turn my neck all the way on one side. The pain from my shoulder would shoot up my neck and cause sharp pains near the base of my skull. It was impacting my mood and my overall quality of life. If these symptoms sound familiar to you, get this item!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Farb,107,78,"I suffer from chronic shoulder muscle and joint pain. This is mostly due to over exersion (and old age, but we won't go there). I've tried OCT pain meds and they never touched the pain. I was sceptical at first but am now pleasantly surprised at how well it works to TEMPORARILY relieve the pain. By no means is this a Cure-all. However, a 30 minute 100/100 session in the evening brings overnight relief. You will have to find the best placement of the pads. Eventually, you will know where to place them for optimum relief. My only complaint is the intensity knobs. I feel absolutely nothing until about 3.5. Then it will wake you up if you over crank it!!"
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,KAT,49,191,"Bought this in 2016 to replace one I had for 10 years & still going strong!!!! Don't turn unit on until you are sure the pads still have good adhesion & they are laying flat (no ripples or kinks) against your body. You will get ""zapped"" if they are not secure. Slowly turn the unit on until it's where you want it to be. Don't have someone else turn it on either they can't feel the pain!! I like this one because there's no timer, I wore it at work on my knee ""under"" a sleeve to keep the pads secure. Dr couldn't find out why I had knee pain. Last year I had a total knee replacements done one in March one in October. I used it after surgery to help with the pain & still use it when needed. I did buy rechargeable batteries using 1 a day it's easier than making sure I have extras. Most important it's not a toy use it properly & it helps reduce pain. I was able to put off surgery for 2 years. It's not a ""cure"" all but will help in pain management."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,ShaeLynn Palmer,38,89,"My local home medical supply store stopped carrying tens units. I bought this one in part of the reviews. I'm very pleased. I bought the unit awhile ago now and am as happy today as when I received it. The pads do not stick well and have gone through several different companies to find some that do. I have found the best hands down is the DONECO TENS Unit Pads 2X2 20 Pcs Replacement Pads Electrode Patches. I have chronic back/hip issues and on the 4th of Jan was in a bad mva where I couldn't turn my head at all. In comes my tens unit! I've been using it every few hours and doing PT and am ready to get back to work. I was having pain into my arm and numbness in my fingers on my left hand constantly. It's now off and on through out the day but getting better. If you are on the fence about the unit my suggestion is to jump, what do you have to lose other then pain and so much more to gain. I will buy this unit again if it ever needs replacing."

I like how compact the unit itself is - actually shirt pocket sized. I like how sticky the electrode pads are, they seem like they should last quite a while. I know I should have read the instructions before trying it out, but didn't until later. I stuck a couple electrodes on my arm, switched it on, didn't feel anything immediately so I turned it up, and - like some reviews say - it shocked me. Like WHAM! I could get the electrode unplugged fast enough. My arm ached for a few minutes, but I was glad to see that this little guy really is strong enough to activate any muscle! I then tried it again with the power dial turned down, and experimented with the different modes and settings, and found it to be every bit as capable as the professional unit I had used in my chiropractors office. I think it will help me fix any sore muscles I get."

Like all other TENS units, the electrode pads lose their adhesiveness quickly, but I am yet to find some that don’t, including those used by my physical therapist.

Looking forward to some much needed pain relief I tore into the package as soon as I got back to work and turned the unit on, I have used TENS units in the past (including the older model of this one I’m writing the review for) so I was ready for some intense therapy around the midpoint on the power scale but the unit I had in hand was a huge let down. I cranked it up to max power and could barely feel the pulses! So with that I jumped on Amazon and ordered this TENS 7000.  Fast forward two days and I’m using it now as I writing this. In my opinion you can’t beat this unit for the cost. At power level 2 this unit is more powerful than the one I paid more money for on full power. I currently have it set at level 3 and can “tolerate” it up to level 4 before the therapy turns from intense to down right painful and there’s still 4 more levels to go!  I can’t recommend this unit enough! If you’re like me and have chronic back pain you owe it to yourself to spend a few dollars and get this unit!"

I bought this unit 4 days in and have been using it daily (before sleeping, while in bed) so it has helped loosen the strained muscles and relieve pain during movement after 6 days of use. Original pads are still viable, it does hurt to pull off leg/arm hair so note that you'll have to do that repeatedly. Comes with a battery which has worked well for 1 weeks worth of hour long sessions but I can tell it will need replaced if needed again. Unit itself is still in perfect working condition so a great purchase for the price!"

The digital readout is nice. The adhesive pads are very sticky. The leads connect well. Most people don’t understand how a tens unit works. It disrupts the pain signal from getting to the brain. That allows him to take much less pain medication. The only problem he has, and I’m not sure this happens to everyone, after a lot of use, his skin gets red and irritated under the patch. I made sure I move it frequently to keep that from happening. One thing to know, they eat 9 volt batteries."

TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,CallMeChaz,417,86,"Mine worked for the few weeks I needed it right after purchase. I went to use it 5 months later and it was dead. Screen comes on for a few seconds, then shuts off. No current. Changed battery with same result. I'll raise it to 2 stars if Roscoe Medical sends a new one, or refunds my money. I'm holding my breath on the 1 year warranty, as some have said they don't respond when called.  That said, when it works it is a great little unit. Powerful enough for most home users, and the lowest setting should be gentle enough. There are two sets of electrode pads, but only the intensity is adjustable separately. The other three settings are shared with both electrodes: pulse width, pulse rate, and burst mode. If you change any of those settings, both sets if pads are changes. Increasing the intensity on one set of pads does not draw away power from the other pads, so you won't feel a ""drop"" when using both sets together.  I don't like the way it shocks you when you bump up a setting. It only lasts for a split second, but you get a pretty good jolt whenever you make a slight adjustment."

I was a bit skeptical about ease of use but it is super easy and convenient to place in your jeans and wonderful for my back pain but have also used on hip , leg and foot and also for my husband’s pulled shoulder muscle. Pease read warnings as it isn’t for anyone with heart problems or a pace maker and never use over the heart as well."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Dmcd,31,17,"I read a ton of the reviews before ordering this and a lot of them say it only last for 2-3 months before it just quits. I don't care if it only last 2 weeks, it's worth the money spent for the pain relief it provides. I have it on now for the first time and it's amazing. If I go past level 3 it is very aggressive, a bit painful, and you can visible see the shock it provides. Right below or at 3, it's not painful, it's just right. I am considering ordering a second one to cover more of my back. If you're on the fence, just order it and return if you don't like it. It's easy to use. Since it's fresh out of the box, I can't speak to how long the pads last but at the moment they stick very well. Very happy with this purchase. I will update if it quits working, but worth the money spent in my mind."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Elijah Tedder,8,59,"As a Physical Therapist Assistant, I highly recommend this product. We use these daily in our Outpatient clinic. There is no true need to buy expensive Tens units with difficult settings. This unit last after many uses. Settings are very easy to understand if you have access to a PT or PTA who can guide you and set the machine. If you do not have access to a professional's advise, the unit does come with instructions. But of course, if you are confused, please consult a medical professional. I personally use this Tens unit for knee occasional knee arthritis flare ups. I will add the electrode pads that come with the unit will wear out, so you may want to buy some extra."

I found this one Amazon and it stated it had been released to be purchased by individuals rather than just doctors. This unit is amazing and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for one. I have purchased additional ones for family members I like it so well. You will be amazed how you feel after it's use.

(Keeping the cords nice, keeping the pads to somewhat reusable, and replacing the 9v once in a while) But..this has done wonders for my husband. He has degenerative disc disease 😔 he's had lower back surgery and has seen physical therapists countless times. He told me this was 10x better than the one they used on him. It took his pain level down to normal! He even walks around the house with it on. I'm thankful that this has helped him in more ways than one."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,KJ,94,45,"I had an old TENS unit which is still working, but I got this unit as a back-up. I must say that it is very good value for money. Only thing that I want to point out is that the switches for intensity control need to be increased very slowly until you can feel the current. If moved up too quickly, you will get a big shock! Overall, it's great, and works well for pain control, and it helps to heal muscle injuries faster imo."
TENS 7000 第二版数字 TENS 装置，带配件,Tom Gonczi,49,28,"This little device works really well. It gives you options on the intensity and a pulsating pattern, if wanted. There is a timer setting as well. The pads adhere very well and are good for multiple uses. I had the intensity set about the middle setting and that was about the most I could stand. There was plenty more of setting left if I wanted to intensify it. It does come with a nice storage case, 4 pads and a 9V battery. The price point was good as well. I would recommend the purchase."

Unfortunately one of my""friends liked it more and stole it and insurance was not going to pay for another one. The only criticism I have is that it only comes with 4 pads and I will order a different brand of pad soon because these stuck good the first time and I had a hard time getting the pads off the plastic supplied and they keep falling off. So great unit but you have to order pads no matter what machine you order, so go with the 4+ star rating and you will be satisfied. I highly recommend this unit."

I had never really integrated resistance band exercises into my routine but I am glad i did. These bands are great for a bunch of very effective workouts on your upper and lower body. I wasn’t sure how best to use them but luckily they come with a very straightforward pamphlet that covers a bunch of great excercises. The carrying case is also a nice plus because without it they would add clutter for sure. I definitely recommend!

"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",John H.,560,3,"All of the bands have broken. They all break at the spot where they join the band to make a loop.  In general the bands have a good amount of resistance and the 5 included are a good mix from lowest to highest resistance. I have been using them for IT Band rehab for the past few months, starting with the lowest resistance. But after a few weeks of use they stretch at the joint and then break. I just move up to the next higher resistance and, however they are all broken now.  If you do buy these don't expect them to last long."

"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Amazon Steve,8426,100,"I purchased two sets of the Fir Simply resistance bands (one for me and another for my wife) as we recently began the 80 Day Obsession workouts. The bands have been working very well, come with 5 (many only had four), and seem to be a quality product at a great price.  For those new to working out with resistance bands I’ll offer a few pieces of advice. First, these bands were a bit too long for my wife’s legs. If you have skinnier legs you’ll want to look for 9” loops, rather than 12” like these are. That will ensure you’re getting a full workout for the full rep. My wife had slack in hers and wasn’t getting a full workout (almost like cheating). For me they worked just fine as far as fit goes. My wife purchased another smaller set.  Band rollup is always an issue with any bands. This can be very frustrating if you’re doing a high intensity interval training like we are and you have to stop to unroll a band. This didn’t happen in the beginning, but as I use these more they seem to occur fairly often. Again, this will happen with all bands.  Overall, I’m happy with the product, they’re holding up very well. I rate a 4/5!  Thank you for reading and rating my review!"
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",j. wood,641,43,I got these to use for beach body’s 80 Day Obsession workout. I spend more time trying to get them to lay flat than I actually do working out. They not only roll but get stuck together. It’s horrible. Save your money and buy a thicker band.
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Sonya,485,194,"Horrible quality. Super flimsy and no resistance worth trying to work out with unless possibly for an elderly person, but they fold/roll immediately. I unpackaged and bypassed to x heavy black band as all others were not worth trying. As soon as I put on and did one m9ve it folded as shown in picture. Bummer... would rate 0 if I could. I don't even work out much, was hoping to at home with these."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Susan Davies,336,52,"I used them for the first time today and I am already returning them. They rolled for nearly every exercise, but thats not even my main reason for the return. I am returning because I cant stand the smell!! It has been on my body all day even after showering and washing my hands several times. Its making me sick to my stomach. I am going to order from a brand that is non-latex and hope I don't have the same issue. Though I am returning, I gave 2 stars since they still felt pretty strong and the resistance was good when they weren't rolling."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Bill D.,5474,260,"Thanks to a number of damaged and arthritic joints, I've been to physical therapy a lot. On some of those occassions, they gave me exercise bands so that I could continue to work at home. So, I have a few of those ""freebie"" exercise bands lying around the house. They did the job, but they always felt thin and cheap to me. Those bands came on a roll and the therapist would simply cut a length of stretch band from the spool, then tie the two ends together to form a ring. Thus, they always had an annoying knot in them which sometimes made them uncomfortable to use.  This time around, I decided to upgrade my home exercises by buying a less ugly and less annoying set of exercise bands. After looking a bit, I decided to give this set from Fit Simplify a try. Here are my notes.  The good points: 1. I must say, I don't miss that annoying knot one bit. The Fit Simplify exercise bands are pre-formed into a continuous ""loop,"" akin to a normal rubber band. As a result there is no knot-tying required to form the loop. It's a smooth, evenly distributed band of rubber with no lumps or bumps of any kind. Because of this, the Fit Simplify bands are far more comfortable to use. 2. Compared to the freebies I got from the physical therapist, the Fit Simplify bands are made of much thicker rubber, which seems to be of more consistent quality. When stretched, they stay consistently thick along every inch of the ring. The physical therapist bands had sections which seemed to stretch thinner than the rest. You could see it because those thinner areas became almost translucent when stretched while other sections were thicker, blocking more of the light. 3. The difference in effort required to stretch each resistance level seems to be better-defined. You can feel an obvious and consistent difference between Medium and Light tension bands, for example. 4. The color coding is useful for picking out the correct band for each exercise at a glance. In addition to the color coding, the bands are clearly-labeled. The junk freebies I have received over the years were also color coded, but had no labels. If you don't know which color means ""heavy resistance,"" you were a bit lost. 5. In this set, you get one band for each of the resistance levels. The resistance levels are X-Light, Light, Medium, Heavy, and X-Heavy. It's a pretty complete set which will apply to most users at most strength levels. 6. This set includes a pamphlet which shows diagrams of some common exercises one can perform using these bands. 7. Even better, they include links to their web site where you can watch a video guide and find their full-color ebook containing a lot more exercises.  The drawbacks: 1. Um...  I'm at a loss to come up with a single negative about these bands. They were a definite and obvious upgrade from the freebie bands I've received from physical therapists over the years. They are consistently high quality. They are well-packaged, color-coded, and well-labeled. The amount of instructional information included is also excellent. They are what they say they are and they do what they say they do. They feel well-made and have no irritating attributes.  Overall, these are the best exercise bands I've ever used, and they are a steal at this price. I highly recommend them.  I hope this was helpful."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Christina Flores,48,18,"They’ve lasted me for 2 years of on/off use, I definitely think they are worth the $18.00 price tag. I recently ordered a new set because my red band (my most frequently used band) was getting a tear in it-but it’s been 2 years I can’t expect for them to last forever!  I bought these back in April 2018 to do Beachbodys 80 day obsession program and have used them on and off since then. I restarted the program again and after finishing the first phase my red band started to get a little tear, so I jumped on here and bought another set!  I received my set a couple days ago- even with this pandemic it only took 48 hrs to arrive on my door step! Opened it up and the bands are still the same quality as I remembered. I’m happy with my purchase!"
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",ChyChy Ely,140,33,These were my first bands ever and I bought them to do my 8 day obsession work outs but we're very disappointed. I did day one and felt with them rolling I figured it was because I wasn't used to them ad probably had them in wrong but day two which was leg day they were a major pain in the a**. I put them on and instant rolling happened no matter which band and where I put it. I'm 5'4 227lbs my thighs are thick. I figure they would roll when I had them above my knees but even at my calves they just rolled. I have a tight schedule to work with and I wasted half of my time fixing the dang things. If your a bigger God don't get them. Now if you have smaller thighs then go for it. They haven't broken yet though I have been fighting with them so that's good I just wish they didn't roll. I will strictly use them for arm exercises.
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",J.Auve,246,81,"I bought these as I wanted more variety in my fitness bands. However, these bands do not fit my needs at all. The lightest band is TOO light so I'll never use it. The black band, which is the heaviest, is not heavy enough. Also, I wear shorts 99% of the time when I'm working out. When these are on my legs or thighs, they constantly are rolling up and do not stay in place well at all. I can double loop the bands for more resistance, but I was looking for bands that had less stretch than these do. I honestly will not repurchase and most likely end up tossing them in the trash."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",AJ,659,132,"These are nice bands. I have pretty thick thighs, and I am not sure if this causes the bands to constantly roll up. I have noticed others doing exercises on IG, and do not appear to have this issue, thick thighs or not. These are okay if you are doing exercises that do not require a lot of movement, such as squats. I tried these on the stair climber, and they kept getting twisted and they became ineffective at that point. Actually cutting off circulation. Very annoying. I ended up just taking these off. I do not think the lightest band is even necessary, it has no resistance at all. I will keep giving these a try, but if I could find some that stay in ""band form"" while doing complex exercises, I would not use these again."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Toni Gethins,89,10,"I was very excited to try these out after reading all the great reviews. Especially from people who were using them for the 80 Day Obsession workouts because that's what I needed them for. The packaging is really nice and I love the variety of resistance. The first couple of times using them I was in love! That love faded though once the powdery coating on them faded too. No matter if I wore pants or shorts, no matter where I placed them on my legs or even how careful I was with my movements the bands would roll in on itself CONSTANTLY. It was annoying to say the least. And when it did it stuck to itself (if that makes sense). So much so that it wasn't something as simple as just unrolling it real quick to get back into the workout. Maybe it's me or maybe it's the bands but ended up a little disappointed with them."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Matt C.,181,23,"Edit 10/26/18: My Light (blue) band became a sticky, goopy mess. I had to throw it out. Might be because I haven’t used the bands in a while.  I am very satisfied with my purchase. I never knew that elastic bands could cause me to feel so much burn! I was very surprised by how durable and elastic these bands are. Even after prolonged rigorous workout sessions, I have noticed absolutely no wear or tear whatsoever! Extremely good quality for the price. I love the strength ladder too. The product comes in a neat little carry bag with 5 different strength tier-based bands. Each band has a different weight estimate. They are as follows: Extra Light: 2-4 lbs, Light: 6-8 lbs, Medium: 10-12 lbs, Heavy: 15-20 lbs, Extra Heavy: 25-30 lbs. I recommend starting out with a lower resistance band and then when it becomes too easy for you move on to the next! The DVD isn’t necessary as the product comes with a user manual that contains several workouts for each part of the body. There are online videos for you to watch too! I 100% recommend this product to any fitness enthusiast -- beginner or expert! I would give 10 stars if I could! Purchase this product! You won’t regret it!"
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",ketchupbottle,216,66,"Three months into using these bands, they just get worse. They roll and ride up.

I'm not using them in any extreme way, either, just normal use on an almost daily basis."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Mom of 3,228,82,"They work. But I only use them an hour a day and after less than a month they are stretched enough that only the black one offers any useful amount of resistance and they roll up and pinch even if you wear gym pants while using them. They are a pain to unstick and unroll between types of exercise. I think if they were thicker length wise, as in wider, they would roll less. Not sure of a solution for they losing resistance so quickly."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Queenofthehouse,9045,253,"I lost a significant amount of weight in a very short time due to an illness and while my actual measurements were small, I had a lot of loose skin. The loose skin wasn’t noticeable in clothes, in fact, I looked tiiiny, but when the clothes came off, things looked a little different.😬🤷🏽‍♀️ Before the pandemic I got my exercise primarily from partner dancing so without that option available to me, I decided to try and tighten my loose skin with some resistance training. I started this journey mid March and bought these bands in May when I felt my routine needed more resistance to build muscle faster. I also bought a faux thigh master contraption and decided I was going to do a 45 minute workout 3 days a week with those devices , do 50 push-ups 5 days a week and use my bands while watching TV a minimum of one Living Single episode’s worth per day.🤓 As for the type of exercises I did with my bands, I just looked up band exercise gifs on the Google and went to town! I did not change my diet, in fact, I ain’t never seen a carb that I didn’t stuff directly into my face hole these comfort eating days.🤷🏽‍♀️  It feels marginally strange to post pics of me in my undies but I think it’s important to show that weight and fitness are not always mutually exclusive and you just can’t tell the difference when I’m fully clothed because I look exactly the same. I try to weigh myself every 4 months and I recently weighed myself thinking I would be at the same weight I’ve been for forever because my clothes fit better, but I went from 104 to 110! That doesn’t seem like a lot, but I am an itty bitty baby carrot of person with a small frame and when I put on any weight it’s generally pretty noticeable, so the weight gain was quite surprising to me. The cool thing is I look and feel more fit, my measurements stayed pretty much the same, except I went from a 30B to a 30C ( thanks carbs!), and got tighter and more muscley all over. I have these bands to thank because they are so easy to just whip out and do some sort of exercise while I’m doing mundane things like watching TV, folding laundry or darning some socks that it makes working out kind of a no brainer! I was able to tone my thighs which is HUGE because those were the parts with the most loose skin, my lower tummy and my arms in record time I think. The only issue I had was that my blue band broke a couple of weeks ago cuz I guess I Hulked out of it? So I took a star off for that. Thus far the rest have stood the test of time,I’m excited to see what further months will bring and I’m super happy I purchased these! 🥳🥳"

I needed something low impact and could easily use. So I ordered them. It has been a few weeks and I have been pleasantly surprised. I can feel the difference. My arms and shoulders are getting stronger. I'm beginning to show some improvement that my wife is noticing. So much so that she is using them while I'm at work. This is a good product. Cheaper than weights and I believe more versatile. I can simulate exercises that I used to do while in the Corps. I wanted something low impact because of surgeries that I've had and these work great. Started with the lowest possible just to get used to them. Now working with the next higher resistance.

"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",DR,538,103,"Great for price. This is no frills light weight loops of rubber resistance band.. An excellent starter kit for small muscle groups and stabilizers shoulder, arm, hand and legs. 2 and 3x cost will be stiffer and more durable. These would be destroyed in a commercial gym setting in a few months. They will give you a few years of use if you don't destroy the rubber integrity - Sun, heat, chemicals, tie in knots or mechanical damage .. You could easily double that by storing in the ( high quality ) individual sleeves between uses. You'll be sorry if you throw the sleeves out. At the price, you can have a couple sets. I have 2 at work desk and use a couple times a day ~1 minute - decompress brain 2 motions Heavy 10 times.. Rubber is soft and doesn't grab hair.. Resistance range is good .. you could exercise a finger or big toe on the low side, carpel tunnel, rotator cuff and make leg stability exercises a MANY times more difficult. 5 stars for money and uses."

I had it at my office previously (we were a little nutty there when we were still in the office pre-Covid) and we would take out the bands and use them regularly after we had been sitting too long. Two other co-workers liked them enough that they bought them too. Upon having to leave the office in March of 2020, the bag came home and my athlete daughter discovered them and used them all the time too when the gyms closed. Weirdly, the bag vanished with her when she went off to college in 2021. (She still says it wasn’t her.) I didn’t even shop around. I looked up my previous order and reordered the same one again.  The 5 bands allow you options for resistance, depending on the level you need. All held up really well with the first set. Bag is basic and does the job. One could easily be put in a car for travel."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Katie B.,1023,61,"I have been slowly working my way into strength training, where before, I was solely a cardio and yoga girl. I watch several you tubers who use resistance bands to either A) warm up or B) increase intensity on various exercises. I chose these bands because of the resistance variation, as well as the outstanding reviews. The price was a wonderful bonus as well, coming in at between 5-10 dollars cheaper than most resistance bands, that typically only include a couple of resistances (however, I could see the use for these other options if you were familiar with resistance bands or knew the resistance intensity you were looking for). The Fit Simplify bands are incredibly lightweight and I still carry them around in the small drawstring bag that was provided (I have owned these bands for a little over a month now). I most often use the top two intensity bands for warming up on leg day. I will use the others for several arms exercises and to increase several specific exercises (mainly to target balancing muscles)."

So far they’ve worked well.  I read a lot of reviews that complained about everything from breaks to having the bands roll while using. Yes, they will eventually break. Take care of them and use them often. And yes, they will roll if you apply too much lateral pressure.  I’ve owned other bands before (physical therapy issued). These are a lot smaller, so they certainly don’t do what the “real” ones do. However, for what I bought them for, they’re fine. If they break, I may buy them again."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Michael J.,243,139,"I bought this version of the exercise bands because it was a little less expensive. This is the best exercise investment I have made! These bands are easy to use. The pamphlet shows some of the exercises that can be performed and I have been creative with a number of others. The strength of the bands varies from extra-light to extra-heavy and can be used individually or by putting two or more together to achieve just the right amount of tension. I use the pyramid method for strength training. That starts me with 8 reps the point where I can't complete more. I then had a band and go to 6 reps, and finally switch the second band to a heavier tension to complete for reps. As a result, I can perform almost all the exercises that I do at the YMCA. It's great, because I can find attention that is right for each of these exercises.  These bands seem quite durable and I see no reason why they won't last a long time. I bought a one set for the house and a second step for my truck so that when I'm out somewhere I can take a few minutes and exercise.  I probably won't win any muscleman contest but these are great at helping me keep my muscles in shape as I age."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",K. David,71,27,"I’ve had these for a year, using them 2 to 5 times per week. While overtime they do stretch a bit, none have snapped and still work very well. Very good quality for the price. I would highly recommend. For what it’s worth, I typically used the red and black, sometimes double looping for leg and glute work. The yellow was also useful for certain upper body exercises."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",It's Me VC,257,91,"I saw some mixed reviews on these but decided to try them out anyways. I have only been working out in my home gym for about a month now, so I am no ""body builder"" but I think these exercise bands are a nice addition to use for my workouts. I don't think I will ever use the green band (comparable to 2-4 pounds) just because I am lifting heavier than that, but I can see how it may come in handy to use if someone might be doing physical therapy or maybe just starting out with weights/bands. I was a little skeptical on how much they may improve some of my exercises, but I was impressed how it added a little something extra for some okay exercises worth doing with the bands. I love the little bag to keep them in and it'll come in handy when my family goes on vacation so I can keep up with my routine and not have to use a public gym. I would definitely recommend and will repurchase again when these get old."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Amazon Customer,48,24,"Love these! Same ones my gym has. Bought them for at home workouts and they are great for lower body exercises (legs and boootay!). They came with a little pamphlet showing some ways to use them too. Which of course I threw away and regret lol. Still trying to figure out upper body exercises with them. I mostly use the medium (yellow) and heavy (red).  Great for wide squats, hip thrusts, fire-hydrants, kickbacks, crab-walks, and plenty of other stuff I don't know the name for :)  I have never had a problem with them rolling. Movements should be moderate paced and controlled, so I never have issues. I imagine if you're going too fast or are realllly sweaty you might run into issues."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",KC_Shopper,282,53,"... than it is of the product.  The product is fine ... it does what I expected it to, and fit my needs perfectly. The 3 star note for Durability is because, after a little over 3 years, one of the bands began to split. I rechecked my original order and found that there was a lifetime warranty, so I decided to see if they meant it.  They do!  My note to them was answered promptly and courteously by Emma, who promised the shipment of a replacement the next business day. They performed as promised and the package arrived today.  These folks are good folks who stand behind their products and provide outstanding customer support."

I am so grateful for the Fit Simply for making a product that helps and aids and gives people the help to reach their potential best.Ten Stars in my book!!!"
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",D. Heidt,61,34,"My doctor suggested I get some resistance bands to aid in restoring strength after some medical procedures. I've been using them for eight days now, but after just a few days I could feel the difference--in both upper and lower body. In addition to doing the exercises in the instruction pamphlet that accompanied the loops, I viewed some YouTube videos to get a better idea on how the system works. I'm not sure about durability, but I started with the easiest level and expect the five levels to see me through a long time. I'm surprised how much I enjoy the exercises."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",AmazonAmateur,54,55,"I love these! I wasn't expecting them to be so durable, but the extra heavy one is legitimately solid and I'm not afraid to do deep lunges or squats with these. I have a couple sitting next to my bed so I can get a couple extra reps in before I sleep, and they're so portable I bring them to the gym to have a variety of resistance exercises with me. I LOVE the guide and discovered that there was more than lower-body strength these puppies are good for! For the price of just 10 bucks or so, my whole family is now wanting a set!"
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Angel,10,17,"To be honest I thought these would be cheaply made. However, I was wrong lol. For those who do BOD you know the loops that you order from them? They’re tough. But these bands have way MORE resistance. I normally use the Blue and Green loop doubled from BOD but the Medium Resistance band from this company is at that INTENSITY. I can’t imagine the horse glutes I’ll have by the time get to Heavy band ( mind you this set came with an EXTRA heavy band) …. The only question is now, the durability. I’ll update if they snap early. But much better price and quality then having to buy from BOD."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Vuong Ly,707,183,"I definitely recommend getting these if you're new to resistance bands training. These are super worth the value for what you're getting. It comes with 5 bands in 5 different resistance levels and a carrying bag. The bands itself is pretty durable if you're not aggressive with it and hasn't shown any signs of wears even after 3 months of using it now. However, they do roll up like others have mentioned. I believe this isn't due to the band itself, but perhaps the band is not heavy enough for you. Slicker clothing and the width of your thighs are contributing factors as well. If that's the case, you should probably try to find latex bands, but these bands, for what they cost, are amazing in value!  Value 5/5 *****. Durability 4/5 ****. My recommendation 5/5 ***** (especially if you're new to band training)"
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",M. Thompson,39,37,"These are perfect so far (although I haven’t yet used the really heavy ones yet). I use the 1st 2 lighter ones for shoulder conditioning and to add a little something extra when doing glute moves. There’s a great variety in resistance depending on the band used, so once I get stronger I can progress to the heavier bands. The only downside is they do roll a bit depending on positioning, but it’s not so bad that the band are destroyed and they haven’t caused me discomfort or messed with my routine at all. The only bands I’ve had that DIDN’T roll at all, were the thick bands by 4KOR (not sure what the material is on those, but it’s like a thicker fabric vs rubber type). Those are great too, but the range of motion is decreased quite a bit from my experience. These are an excellent supplement to do the movements that require extra stretch!"
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Bullwinkle495,566,131,"I bought these to bring some variety into my home gym. They are graded in different strengths, and the ""weight"" of each band is listed in the instructions. They are sturdy and fun to work with. Hook it up to the top corner of your door, shut the door, and do lat pulldowns! Wrap it around your knees and do adductors! Step on one end, and lift the other as a curl! There are lots of things to do here. The entire point is to have a device to give you resistance for certain movements that are impossible or difficult with traditional weights. These do the trick. Some people complain of ""rolling up""--but I don't know what exercises they're doing, because I haven't had a problem. Note: the ""instruction book"" is a PDF online, and it's quite beefy."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Ray,18,6,"I take a stretch class that uses and provides these resistance bands, but I wanted to have my own. The yellow one demonstrated is medium... two others (red & black) are harder, and two are easier (green and blue). I mostly use the black (pretty tough for this guy, and others in the class use mostly the lighter ones) and when I get fatigued I switch to the red so I don't compromise form. The non-stretch strap with letters on it at the top of the photo is a different product/vendor my class also uses that I ordered on Amazon. It has loops you can put your feet through while lying on a mat and perform different controlled stretches safely. Both products permit controlled exercise, but the resistance bands are more versatile and get used in more ways providing a strong workout without weights or machines. Great reliable products well priced! Love that I didn't have to go to a store to get them. Delivery was fast... class is once a week on Saturdays. I ordered after the first class and had them before the next one. Can't say anything but good things about these products! Comes with a carry/storage bag. Great for my class, and I can use them at home too."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Sarah L. Nichols,7,41,I had purchased these bands during 2020 when I found out that I had torn my labrum. I started strengthening my rotator cuff and shoulder using these bands and the exercises prescribed by the Physical Therapist. It's now 2021 and I'm 4 months post surgery and still using these bands regularly. They have held their strength well and I have used every band resistance level in there at different points of therapy and recovery. Great bands to purchase at a great price. And I just purchased a set for my coworker.
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Miranda L.,44,32,"I love this product and love the handy carry/storage bag. The usage guide is helpful but I love that there are also free videos and free downloadable ebooks. That’s quite a value for only $10.95! I have physical limitations and am in physical therapy but I wanted to get something to exercise with at home too. These will be great because of the different resistance levels which will allow me to work up to the next level. I will do whatever exercises I can to improve strength and try to save and regain muscle mass. I know that if you don’t use it, you lose it and I’m trying not to lose it. These will allow me to use either sitting on a chair or lying on my bed. I highly recommend this seller and will buy from them again. My product was packed nicely and arrived in the designated 2 day Prime time."

It comes with a small pamphlet to let you know some simple excercises that anyone can do. The nice thing about the bands is that they are in varying strengths, therefore, this set is adequate for my husband(who would use one of the much stronger bands) and myself. The lightest strength band seems really easy until you do multiple reps the way indicated. According to the pamphlet you are to hold each excercise for 3 seconds. I feel these are a definite benefit for anyone looking to do low impact strength training excercises. There are also Youtube videos of many different excercises that can be done with these bands. You can't go wrong for under $10."

I had for few weeks and it works like a charm. it gives you plenty of resistance when I work out and way easier to change and less dangerous. I am sure that there are other types of exercise for using these, but for me, it works out absolutely perfect for my total gym resistance bands. thanks. this was a great buy."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Dell Bean,22,18,"Didn't include a rating for durability since this product hasn't been used long enough to evaluate that. These bands are very portable, as for travel use, and very compact and relatively lightweight. Suggested uses are included in the literature, but these can be used in the same way as tubular bands can. They can be used separately or combined to increase resistance at many levels. It is my suggestion to cover the band with some form of cloth or other when they are exposed to rough surfaces such as underfoot against concrete -- just a preventive measure, like wearing lifting gloves with weights."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Enos One,38,23,"So let's be clear, these resistance bands aren't going to make you lose that Quarantine 15 all on their own. It's going to require the discipline to make time to exercise. Whether you're staying at home or travel, these resistance bands are perfect as they fold down nicely and come in a very easy to carry pouch. Even when the gym opens back up, you might not be willing to start pawing all those public surfaces, and carrying these resistance bands can help minimize the number of questionable surfaces you'll be coming in contact with. Overall very happy with the purchase and look forward to seeing just how durable these actually are (for now they seem sturdy enough)."

I'm using the bands to get my legs in better shape so my knee stops acting up. I so very happy that I bought these and they have their own little bag."

We used every band from the lightest weight (light green) to the black one. My trainer worked my arms, deltoids, triceps, and we also used the bands for ankles, too!  I am so pleased that the tension level is clearly marked on each band.  I plan to take these with me when we travel in their own little bag. I think these bands are a great value and I plan to use them in regular workouts."
"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",lord of the ducks,10,37,"Most of these bands are useless (to me) because they offer so little resistance. I only use the black band, which is the highest resistance band. That being said, I think this is a really great set for beginners or for people just trying to increase their range of motion. Even when I'm scared that they're going to stretch or snap, they go right back to their original size. I think they will wear with time, but that's a given with any resistance band."

"Fit Simplify 阻力环锻炼带,带说明书和便携包,5 件套",Sharon K.,83,77,"The rubber bands that clip together with carabiners get pretty bulky when you use more than one. They also rub your forearms when used in a door to simulate a bench press. These will still pull the hair on your forearm, but are much more manageable. I like the separate bands for different resistance much better. This one is a good ""rubber"" and has a continuous feel to it without jumps or bottoming out of the force."

I'm doing not only P/T exercises with these but am finding other exercises that are very helpful. The website is good and you can just watch what other people do in the gym and add the bands for resistance.  I like that they come in a pouch that I can easily put anywhere. The website, instructions are really good.  I'm enjoying them a lot."

These work great for my leg exercises (haven't tried them for arm exercises but they should work well too). I have had my set for over a year with no issues with durability. The only issue I notice is that the lighter weight bands tend to get a little rolled on themselves if you are not careful. They can be unrolled but it's a bit of a pain. I still liked them enough to order a second set for traveling because I use them so frequently.

They’re thicker , yet still feel comfortable when using. They have the resistance needed. Some I’ve had in the past didn’t seem to give as much resistance.  I like the bag it comes with, for traveling and also for storage. My work out room has a lot of sunlight come in so it’s good for storage so they don’t wear out from the sun.  These bands are great for a lot of gluten and lower body exercises that are simple but very effective. They’re always in my work out routine, even when lifting weights."

I enjoy the different amounts of resistant in each band which allows me to use lighter resistance for harder exercises and heavier resistance to push myself.  Simple and easy to store in small black bag they provide.  Durable: have used many times and no signs of wear and tear.

Only negative is that I feel as if they could be more resistant/strong. I have fairly strong hips but am using the red band (2nd strongest). I sometimes feel as if I could even snap that. As I improve strengthening, I wonder if I will find that they are all too easy. However, I am sure I could go through the instructions/Ebook and find some upper body activities in which the lower resistance bands will be well suited. Good product overall."

She contacted the Company and within hours they replied expressing their regret and their commitment to their products & customer satisfaction. They sent her a replacement set immediately.

The blue one and the yellow one can help you put some resistance on your kick backs or hip thrusts.

I've even used 2 bands at once (one on top of the other) to add just a bit more resistance. So far, I haven't had any problems with rips in my bands.

The therapist used the bands for each of the exercises I did, so I bought a set to have when the ones she gave me got too stretched out.

I struggle to find tape strong enough to hold them up right without peeling off from sweat and without it hurting like crazy when you peel it off or leaving residue. Well ladies, this tape holds EM up really nicely, can withstand the heat, and removes easily without leaving any residue. I will say though, removing the tape from your nipple does hurt a bit (maybe I’m just too sensitive), so I would cover your nipples and then tape over them. But I recommend this tape for sure! It almost looks like a tube top on me lol."

Needless to say; not wearing a bra was freeing. I advise a practice run before going out because the process is a little frustrating at first. I wore the tape in 100 degree Texas heat during an outside wedding and it didn’t budge. The removal process requires patients. I used baby oil. Stand in the bath tub and completely saturate the tape with the baby oil and let sit for about five minutes. When pulling the tape off, firmly hold your skin and gently pull the tape away from the skin. It’s a process but I think it’s worth it. Five stars for sure!!"

I’ve always avoided backless or strapless dresses but this is the perfect solution. The tape is a little tricky to handle, takes a bit of time and maneuvering, application would probably be easier with two people but once it’s on, I feel completely secure. Tape is extremely sticky which adds security but makes removal slightly painful, still so worth it!! Insane lift and durability, I’d highly suggest this product!!

"Boob Tape 和 2 件花瓣露背乳套套装,透气乳房提升胶带带带硅胶乳房花瓣 可重复使用粘合文胸 A-E 罩杯大乳房",Crystal,219,1,"This is my second order for this boobie tape. I am a 42 yo woman, size 14 with D cups. I would definitely recommend and plan on ordering again.  A few key notes to consider:  Pros: - Strong adhesive - Tape is very stretchy and flexible - Used 3 strips for excellent hold; 2 strips for good hold - Used enough tape to go about an inch under my boob to about an inch over my shoulder - Used the nipple petals and they are comfortable. They have a sticky adhesive but it's not super strong so doesn't hurt to take off. - Lines on the back of tape so you know exactly how long to cut for each strip to be even - Held up to dancing and a night on the town (6-8 hours) Could definitely go longer. - Does not hurt to remove. It's not completely painless but it's easy. Like a band-aid.  Cons: - Leaves a slight sticky residue after removal - I was able to get 4 uses out of the roll. Again, I have D cups and each strip was long enough to cover about an inch under my boob to around an inch over my shoulder. I used 2-3 strips per boob per use. Make sure you order more than 1 if you plan on using often. - This isn't really a con but you have to be very careful when applying. The adhesive is very sticky and if you peel the back of the tape too fast or don't apply slowly, the tape stretches so it will retract and expand, sticking to itself."

As a mother who breastfed 3 kids I unfortunately am left with c-cup “pancake boobs”. So when I went to wear a backless, deep plunge shirt to an event there was no way I could go without a bra. I bought this product and was skeptical if it would work for me. I tried it the 1st time and didn’t get the desired effect but after doing some research and finding YouTube videos I learned the different ways you could use it which made the 2nd attempt a success.  Made me feel confident to wear the top I had picked out. Put it on around 5pm on a Friday afternoon. Went out dancing all night without anything budging one bit. Then realized I forgot to pack a bra to wear under my work uniform so I slept with it on, and in the morning kept it on under my scrubs for work. Wore it for 16 hours during my physically demanding job in nursing. Came home that night to finally take it off and everything was exactly how it was when I first applied it and was comfortable the whole time. Despite the fact that the tape was clearly of strong adhesive it peeled off easily when I removed it.  This product is a lifesaver and I will def always keep it stocked in my house and am excited to be able to wear more tops that I couldn’t otherwise pull off bcuz even strapless bras did nothing for me."

I will say please remove it properly. I had a little “unwanted” assistance and it tore my skin in a spot, sounds worse than it looks. The rest of the process was handled with care. Is definitely recommend this. I used about four 6 squared strips and that was too much but i did that so i could cut the extra off in the shape of my outfit. But I’d say 4 is good for top to bottom and i did two or three 8 squares across can’t remember.  Excuse my photos…the photographer never let us get ready lol"

I was kind of on the fence but decided to purchase anyway. So glad I did. I used them under my swim suit and it held up while I was in the pool and jacuzzi. Removal was easy as well. I saturated it my body oil and gently pulled the tape away with ease. This is definitely going to be a repurchase.
"Boob Tape 和 2 件花瓣露背乳套套装,透气乳房提升胶带带带硅胶乳房花瓣 可重复使用粘合文胸 A-E 罩杯大乳房",Ronald Capalongan,122,67,"I have used both this tape and kinesiology tape and although they're almost identical this tape is better for several reasons.  Tip: to prevent the ends from curling back, make sure you don't streach the ends before pressing to the skin. I prefer to stretch the middle and attach it, and then gently lay the ends down and press them into place.  First, most kinesiology tape comes in pre-cut sections. This tape can be custom cut to any length. Secondly, this tape just sticks much better to skin and on the ends than kinesiology tape. I've even showered with this tape on with no issues.  Initially, I purchased this for a special dress I had and needed chest support. But honestly I have used this tape for all the other purposes I'd usually use kinesiology tape for because it just works better.  You may still need to have a few layers to achieve the desired support as a bra, but I'd need to do the same thing with Kinesiology tape.  The nipple shields are nice too."

I have somewhat sensitive skin but after a 6 hour arm test and a 6 hour breast test, I felt like I was safe to use it on both breasts for an evening event. The nipple covers are reusable (I put them in a ziploc bag with the adhesive against the plastic insides) and the tape itself is slightly stretchy. Great lift, great staying power - I wore it for about 8 hours before removal. I was comfortable and didn’t experience any long-term redness or irritation, just a little bit at first removal. I slathered the area in Bio Oil after removal and my skin looked normal the next morning. Remove the tape VERY SLOWLY. Will definitely recommend this product to a friend and would use it again. I think I can get at least 2 uses out of the roll. I’m 38 DD for reference."

I also so the reviews about how it leaves horrible marks on your skin. However, I said to myself I really don’t have sensitive skin so I can buy. I use the product for the first time today and it does hold for real and it’s very stretchy so you don’t have to use a lot. I had it on for approximately two hours and as soon as I got home I tried to remove it and I took my time and it the worse I’ve ever seen my breast. I have uploaded a short video for you to see. It looks like residue from the tape that’s on my breast but it’s actually my scorches from the tape. My skin will look shine in the video cause I put some Shea oil on it.

The Universe laughed at me when I was born and said, ""You shall forever have a chest of a prepubescent girl."" (Geee, thanks.) Anyway, I bought this tape because some of the characters I cosplay are super busty. I have my fake foam boobs (lol!) that I use as a sort of prosthetic, and let me tell you, this tape holds up those big heavy foam things. I can even wear a halter top that is practically backless (one of the characters I cosplayed has a revealing top) and this tape held those things in place like there was no tomorrow! Yay! So I imagine that this tape would held all you lucky busty ladies! It's strong stuff. I have super sensitive skin, so when I take off the tape, my skin is a bit pink (where the tape was) but goes away in a few minutes."
"Boob Tape 和 2 件花瓣露背乳套套装,透气乳房提升胶带带带硅胶乳房花瓣 可重复使用粘合文胸 A-E 罩杯大乳房",Amber,16,22,"I was skeptical but I have weddings and events coming up and I needed to try something without a bra. First of all, always test a strip on your breast for the same amount of time you will be wearing it or more (8hrs recommended). Second, I would also recommend to test out the brand and then buy a second roll if you like it. Not unless it's not your first time using bra tape, I had to use one whole roll and two different ways to get the idea and shaping. Second, it's sticky and held up my breast well! I'm a 36C and i do have bit of a sag/teardrop so the challenge for me was the shape similar to a bra cup. For my tube top, a bando was too constricting after awhile, and it did hold up but the method of taping (tape from one side breast to the other) and long hours made me uncomfortable with breathing - the shaping made me look like i had one large breast in the middle lol. So Look at youtube videos and such to get an idea, and then apply that to your own breast. Everyone's breasts are shaped differently - and then check to see if what you're taping matches how it will look at the clothing you're wearing since i had to adjust tape placement. if you don't get it right, i would mark your skin with a easy to remove pen of where your clothes will be placed. So for my breast, someone recommended to me to tape vertical first (small strip or however length you feel to get that lift) to get lift as this will kind of be your guide and anchor (start out with one strip if you can). (Shout out to the one who answered my question and helped me figure it out!) Then, use multiple strips vertical to get the shape you want. and then for hold in place, i taped across one boob to my lateral side. and then add however strips you need for support. Trim tape if needed. I also cupped my breast with my hand to the shape i want and used the tape to hold it in place. i love how my breasts look when i wear a bra so i tried to get that same look with this method.  So yeah, it's a bit of maneuvering and practice in my experience, but it feels and looks amazing! i like how i'm not wearing a bra with wires or worried if my straps are showing or slipping off my shoulders or adjusting my bra here and there. videos are great but try to practice with it, as i had to use a whole roll to get it right.  Con: i can see someone go through one roll easily if they need more support and shape so long term, it can get pricey. especially since i wasted one roll for practice and bought two more for upcoming events. but for the hassle free bras, i think it's worth it for me.  i haven't tried it in water or in humid weather."

My boobs are SAGGY... you look up the definition of saggy in dictionary and there my boobs are. I have a size G boobs and not wearing a bra isn’t an option. I got this tape for my wedding day and I will now be keeping a STOCK of this tape in my closet. I felt very secure and was able to take it off very easily after trying it out for a little bit.

I didn’t and it hurt to remove the tape from my nipples. If you don’t have them, use a piece of toilet paper at least. I’ve never felt so free or light weight before. Amazing product. I’m a B cup. I can’t go without a bra, but I need lift for sure. I cleaned the house extreme style to see how it lasted. My boobs never moved. Sweat didn’t kill the adhesive at all. After 8 hours, it started to itch a bit so I removed it before bed or I was going to try to sleep in it. A tiny bit of adhesive residue remained. I think I’d not be embarrassed If I was using boob tape and then became intimate. It is soft and stretchy. The stretch allows for you to use less than you’d think you’d need. I taped my boobs over my shoulder."
"Boob Tape 和 2 件花瓣露背乳套套装,透气乳房提升胶带带带硅胶乳房花瓣 可重复使用粘合文胸 A-E 罩杯大乳房",Larra,586,51,"I’ll start with the good: This stuff sticks. It is not going anywhere until you want it to. I wore it for 8+ hours to a wedding in Texas and it didn’t even budge. I jumped in the shower to remove the tape like some other reviews recommended and for the most part it came off cleanly with minimal discomfort except right at the top of where it applied (where there was the most pulling on my skin).  Now for what could be improved: The manufacturers should consider more comprehensive application instructions to prevent skin damage. I have used similar products (kinesiology tape) for athletic injuries, but never boob tape so I think the irritation and abrasions I ended up with were likely a result of not knowing how to best apply it.  I feel like this resulted in my applying with too much tension on my chest which pulled and caused the abrasions you see in the included photos.  All this to say, I think most of the poor reviews for this product could be avoided if they included clear and complete instructions for application and removal (even a QR link to a tutorial video would work great).  Would I recommend this? Probably. I would also caution potential purchasers to do a trial run so you feel comfortable applying (especially if you are large chested and using this for actual support), and to make sure it doesn’t feel like the tape is pulling or pinching anywhere as that seems to be what caused the skin damage."

This tape held my girls up very well throughout the night- even through sweating! While I was placing the tape, I didn’t have to use much because it stretched a good amount so a little goes a long way! It never budged, slipped or lost its stickiness! It was difficult to remove only because it was painful. Edit: this was my second time using this tape. As expected it stayed on well throughout a night of partying/sweating.

I recommend removing the tape in the shower. This stuff is sticky, so it will hurt coming off. I removed the nipple covers & then hopped in the shower will all of the tape still on. Once it was soaked, it was easier to remove. I used baby oil to removed excess adhesive.  I also have very sensitive skin. I had a mild rash where the adhesive was (not with the nipple covers though), but it didn’t hurt or itch. Cortisone cream did the trick & the red marks were gone within 24 hours!"

She is lucky enough to have a tiny waist but she has a good sized chest. We have a hard time finding things that fit her well. You sort of cant go wrong with this tape. The reusable nipple covers are very soft and cover everything perfectly. The tape is also pretty supportive and held her up even through dancing and sweating. I am not sure how long this roll will last however I am considering purchasing a second just to have on hand as this is a womens miracle item! Me being almost 40 and not having the firmest of skin was also able to use this tape with no issues. I do recommend this for all shapes and sizes!

I used it to help with my opened back dress for a wedding. They didn’t go anywhere and it held the whole night. The only thing I would like to mention is that this probably worked TOO well. When I took it off it did adhere to my skin pretty well so this is definitely not for sensitive skin. It left me a mark across/under my bust but I don’t mind it. I’m sure it will come off in time. I’m just happy it worked! It’s hard for big cheated women to find what works so I’m happy with it and i would buy it again!

I was able to wear an incredibly low cut too that no bra would work with. It held them up all night and gave me the most banging cleavage. My husband couldn’t stop commenting on the natural jiggle the tape allowed. It looked as if I just had the most spectacular natural breasts with no sag at all. I wish it was a little wider for beasts my size because it’s hard to get started with the initial piece of tape. Other than that this is amazing. I ordered two more boxes so I can show off these puppies more often! I feel so free.

It kept my boobs secure the whole night and I didn’t have to worry about it coming off. VERY secure. The only thing is my skin was a little sore after I took the tape off, but after seeing reviews prior to buying this product I was already prepared. If you’re looking for affordable tape that gets the job done this is the product for you!"

This definitely works and holds! I knew taking off would be difficult from reading reviews, and they werent wrong. I removed while showering the tape and also using oils, still lost a small patch of skin…but if u go slowly/patiently it does come off. Im amazed that most came off as well as it did, especially with how much i used! There was still some tape residue the following days too. Was all worth it! I practiced tapping a few times to make sure the placement worked best for my dress. Overall, was very pleased with the hold thru the day and so happy to not have a single worry about the tape until it was time to come off!"

Super secure, just gently wash the area after GENTLY removing the tape, and lotion accordingly. Super reliable, survived a water park and a sweaty outdoor day in costume Buy more than 1 single box. You'll use almost the entire box in one go - this brand is well worth it though compared to the others ive tried. Nothing is worse than having unreliable body tape"

It's a bit more stretchy than I expected so cut shorter lengths than you feel might be needed. The directions were pretty minimal so I watched a YouTube video. Definitely need to practice before I'm ready to go out in that strappy summer outfit. I am a 38DD so I do need extra support and from my initial try, I think it will work fine."
"Boob Tape 和 2 件花瓣露背乳套套装,透气乳房提升胶带带带硅胶乳房花瓣 可重复使用粘合文胸 A-E 罩杯大乳房",Alex T.,0,2,"I LOVE this tape! I’m non-binary transgender and I use this tape to bind my chest. I use two 4-6 inch strips on each breast pulling from the center of my chest to outside. I wear the tape when I don’t want to wear my binder 4-8 hours maximum a day a few times a week and this roll has lasted about 8 wears, which is less than 2 dollars a wear and the nipple cover are still holding strong! I only had a little torn skin once and that’s because I went a little over the 8 hours and I didn’t put enough oil on the tape when I was pulling it off (I drenched the tape in organic olive oil ever time I took it off). A few times I had left over sticky black tape residue (which was annoying and took multiple hot showers to get off). That is why I only gave it 4 stars but other than that, this product seems WAY better than TransTape for about the same price WITH reusable nipple covers!"

I was scared my sweat was going to make it fall down as I was taking my grad pictures on a humid day, but they kept my boobs up the entire 2 hour photoshoot. This is an amazing deal and I would recommend if you tend to wear backless tops or things that show your bra. Super satisfied with this product and it's 100% worth it."

Wore to a wedding for approximately 8 hours with dancing and worked great! Would definitely purchase again. Only downfall was taking off... very sensitive on the nipple area. Not sure if i was supposed to cover my nipple first with the flower but i definitely will next time. Overall great purchase.

This holds with only 2-3 strips per breast and honestly will last you all night even in tropical climates. I got many compliments on my “girls” last time I rocked a deep V and even had someone convinced I had implants to which I do not. Go team!

I’m a 40 DDD and I though all hope was lost. After watching many YouTube tutorials I was able to tape the girls up. The tape lasted the whole wedding. The top rolled a little bit but it still did the job. No one could see the tape but I knew it had my back. Well... my front. I would suggest not using the nipple flowers though, those hurt way worse coming off than the tape."

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED using the pasties. I made the mistake of using the tape with out it and I felt my soul rip out trying to get the tape off. Once the tape is on it WILL NOT move, which it’s the point lol. I found using some sorting of oil( I used baby oil) as well as doing it slower was the easiest for me. The next day I did have red marks on my chest exactly where the tape had been for about a day or two. Overall I highly recommend this product!❤️"

These work really really welll!! I’m surprised. I’m a size D And did not expect it to hold well and first time using tape. Held up for 6-7 hours . But the getting it off part hurts a little. Nothing to crazy! I was wearing a one shoulder top and when the tape was too long I could just cut the tape till it wasn’t showing! Love

It did start to itch but I think it was due to me sweating. Easy to remove once I drenched area in water. PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REMOVE WITHOUT WATER OR OIL BASED PRODUCT! Most of the people that said it left a scare probably did not read where it says to use water or oil 😂 I also used the nipple covers and they were good to. Only downside is that the shape of the nipple covers could be seen through my shirt but they held up as well. Nipple covers and boob tape worn at different times.

I didn’t have it on that long so I’m not sure about it being sweat proof. I would purchase again but I wish there was an option to get a larger supply. I love to use this tape instead of a bra because it makes my back feel so free and is virtually undetectable with outfits that are intended to be worn bra-less or with a strapless bra.

It’s also significantly cheaper than KT tape which is nice if you have to cover your tattoos every day. I just cut it to fit the size of whichever tattoo I’m trying to cover.

The bridesmaid dress I have to wear doesn’t allow for a traditional bra and I am very top heavy at a 36G. I tried those lifting pasty covers and the adhesion give way immediately. This tape on the other hand held up after putting one piece, then I added 3 others to shape my breast the way I wanted it. For the actual day of the wedding I have to move it over a centimeter or two so it doesn’t show but this tape really works! Not to get graphic but I have pretty low breasts and this tape raised me up a couple inches to the point where I had a space between my under boob and rib. I would definitely pass the “pencil test” while using this tape."
"Boob Tape 和 2 件花瓣露背乳套套装,透气乳房提升胶带带带硅胶乳房花瓣 可重复使用粘合文胸 A-E 罩杯大乳房",Amazon Customer,3,4,I was hesitant to try this product since my skin can be quite sensitive. I had a dress that had a cut down the front to about 1 inch above my belly button so a bra would have been easily seen. I put the tape on around 430 pm and wore it at an outdoor concert and out on the town. There was never one moment where I didn't feel secure or a time where I felt the tape was loosening no matter how sweaty or how much I was moving. I removed it around 11 pm. It came off easily. I didn't not need to use any oil or anything to assist it. It felt very similar to the removal of athletic tape to me. It did leave some residue but that came off the next day when I showered.

The edges did start to peel a bit but could have been user error in applying. I'm a 34D and felt secure wearing this under a backless romper. I had a rash and burst blood vessels upon removing, but I admittedly ripped these off dry. Had I wet them down or use rubbing alcohol or baby oil I might not have had these issues."

This tape holds all day, you can peel it off and restick when you need to adjust. I have sensitive skin and while it did leave red marks on my body, they were gone by the time I got up the next day. I used this tape for multiple days in a row and still didn’t have a break out or rash caused. The back of the tape has a grid so you can easily cut the same length for each side. Great buy"

I am reusing the petals. However, when you place the tape, DO NOT try to move or change it, it will not stick back well."

With all the sweating, I thought it would start pealing off for sure but it didn't! It stayed in place for 12hrs plus! At the end of the night it was super duper easy to remove! And most importantly pain free! The trick is to go in the direction of the little hair! Overall I highly highly recommended this product!! I totally will be buying again when I run out!!!"
