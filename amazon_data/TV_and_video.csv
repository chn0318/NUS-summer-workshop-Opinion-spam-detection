"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Hoppaguy,26318,3348,"The Good: -Fast (no lag) -Incredible streaming quality -Easy set up -Longer range wifi -Same compact size as previous generation -Voice recognition on remote works well -Comes with batteries for remote  The Bad: -Have to resign into all apps but that’s not a surprise  The Bottom Line: I just set up this new Roku Streaming Stick 4K and watched a movie on Netflix. I set up the streaming stick in less than 5 minutes. It took a little longer to re-log back into all my services like Amazon, Netflix, etc. but that was expected. As for performance, this streaming stick is faster than the previous generation Stick+. There is no lag whatsoever with this new one. The wifi is definitely longer range since I can move the stick to the garage and there is no lag when I move it out there compared to the older streaming stick. The picture is awesome and you can watch 4K without any issues. The remote works well and the voice recognition recognizes my voice well. If you’re wondering what the difference between the 4K streaming stick versus 4K streaming stick+, the only difference is the remote. Overall, I would recommend this new Roku streaming stick 4K for its streaming quality, speed and longer range wifi."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Tempterall,254,20,"A month ago, our ISP upgraded our modem to a smart modem. Because of this, our old Roku device (which was a 2018 model Express) could not maintain a connection to the WiFi for the life of it. It was only two rooms away, yet was constantly dropping connection.  I went online and saw this one was being marketed as ""long-range WiFi"" and decided to go ahead and buy it. I can't express how much of a good decision that was. This streaming stick maintains a 4/5 connection at all times, loads instantly, and is in every way an upgrade from our 2018 Express.  I love how this remote has power, volume, and mute buttons for the TV too, that's very convenient. The voice control is great. Most devices can't understand me because I have a lisp, but this streaming stick doesn't seem to have any problems with my voice.  I'm always cautious spending upwards of $30 on anything because we're pretty poor, but in this case, this streaming stick was 100% worth the $50 it cost."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",JM,224,36,"I like the available apps, especially Spectrum TV. The voice remote fearure is super nice and makes it easy to find what you're looking for. The Roku app on my phone has a remote feature which is awesome!! If you don't have the remote nearby you can just use your phone. It also allows you to use your phone keyboard to type your login info for your apps-much easier. The Roku was very easy to set up and use. I have this and the Firestick. I like this better. The Roku has a lot more apps available. The 4K steaming quality was pretty equivalent. I recommend the Ruku."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Spartacus #1,149,40,"This upgraded Roku streaming device was just released by Roku and I received the item yesterday.  I was having poor reception with an older Roku stick as the TV was far from the modem. This new device is fantastic; great picture, speedy download speed and no loss of signal strength.  Highly recommended.  ADDENDUM: I have been using this 2021 ROKU for 4 days. This new 4K model is a game changer and I may switch my older ROKU streaming sticks to this new model; it is that good. It allows me to take advantage of the excellent resolution on my 4K televisions. My download speed is 144!!! I subscribe to a 500 speed from COX communication. The new ROKU device is far from the modem at the other end of a large home. Full Disclosure: I am so impressed with ROKU products that I have purchased ROKU stock."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Matthew P Smith,462,35,"I bought this specifically because I was having trouble with my old Roku Premiere+ being able to stream YouTube videos in 4K. It would always default to standard definition or worse and never get any better. This should not have been happening, as I have 100 mbps fiber internet service. For reference, YouTube 4K requires 20 mbps, which I have 5x the requirement for.  So, I decided that because this model was touting ""long-range wireless"" that maybe this would remedy the problem. It did not. The claims are that this model has 2x the wireless speed of previous Rokus. Maybe this is true, but the actual speed it does get is absolutely terrible.  I have attached two pictures to this review. One is of the wireless speed that the Roku is saying it has (purple screen), which is 2 mbps. Bear in mind, this is about 10ft from my wireless router. The second picture is of a speed test that I ran (on the WiFi) of my iPhone literally laying on top of the Roku at the TV and it is getting 122 mbps up and down.  So, you can see why I am having so many issues with streaming in general with this thing. This device is only capable of utilizing 1.6% of the speed that my wireless router is delivering. My advice to most people looking at this thing, avoid at all costs. There are many other streaming options that will reliably deliver the speeds you need for proper streaming.  Update: 10/23/21  So, after a week of pulling my hair out with this thing, I decided to format it to return it. Thankfully, I decided to give it one last shot before sending it back.  I’m glad I did, because after the format, it started miraculously working for about 3 days now. It gets 150+ mbps. I checked all of the settings to see what exactly had changed. Turns out it was my wireless router assigning a terrible channel to the Roku!! It put it on channel 1 initially. Same with my old Roku Premiere. Both were getting 2 mbps. For whatever reason, it assigned this Roku after formatting to channel 48 on my network and that fixed everything.  So, your mileage really may vary here. You may not have the router problem I had and it works flawlessly, or you may have the same or worse. I still kind of feel like this could be an issue involving Roku, like the Roku maybe should tell the router “Hey, this channel sucks, please give me a different one!”  I have updated my review to 4 stars because it is the best streaming device out of all that I have tried. Roku is a great company with a great UI. I just can’t quite give it 5 stars because of the WiFi issues because I don’t know if the blame is fully on my router, since I don’t have any other devices having issues."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Goldengate,15464,1967,"We have been a Roku family since they first came out and looked like little hockey pucks. We have streaming sticks on all of our TV's and find them easy to use. However they do sometimes lag a little and I was interested to try this latest version to see the speed difference. Startup is about the same - maybe 2 seconds less of the ""Bouncing Roku"" logo. Menu navigation is super fast with zero lag. There still is the ""spinning wheel"" as videos are first loaded and we have a gigabit connection with super fast WIFI in our house.  Am I going to upgrade the rest of our Rokus to this model? Probably not -- the difference isn't that large. However this is a great streaming stick that offers all the major streaming services (Youtube may vanish in December pending a contractual dispute), great voice control and an intuitive remote. The whole thing is super easy to set up.  Highly recommended!"
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",AmazoMaureenn Customer,164,134,"I bought this to save money. I paid about $50. After 3 days, it froze. I tried to get help from customer service, but was told I needed to give them my credit card info, starting with a $1. charge to chat with an agent. After an intro price of $1. I would be charged $45. monthly. After a simple reboot, it now works. When I bought this, I was trying to save money! If you want an alternative to cable, Don't buy this thing!"
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Sara @ Coastal Carolina Soap Co.,18,13,"Ages ago, my husband gifted me with a Roku device for our anniversary that was suitable with the ancient TV we had at the time. Later that year or the year after, we received a flat-screen TV. With time comes changes in tech, and while our TV might be more high-tech and great, the device had become less so. Enter the Roku 4K stick, a compact little device that offers big improvements over the small box streaming unit we had. It's powerful enough to pick up the wifi signal from the other side of the house, and it has some speed to it! No longer having do we have to watch as the blue circle of impatience spins hypnotically while our shows load. The picture is crystal clear and we love the updated features over our old device. The old one served us well which made the decision simply to upgrade our Roku device (as opposed to switching brands) an easy one."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",MojoJojo,245,96,"I've had a Roku ever since the first Roku brick hit the market and have had my share of the generational devices. Each Roku release has been better in some way than its predecessor before it The Roku Streaming Stick is no different.  I bought two of these. One to add another Roku device to my home that was less expensive than my Roku 3 and one for my girlfriends house whom is a first time Roku user and 'former' Roku nonbeliever.  Holy cowpie is this thing AWESOME!!! I am amazed that something so small actually has the ability and power to change a not so smart TV into the most amazing smart TV you've ever owned!!!  I have an Amazon firestick for one of my TVs to make it smart. Sucks compared to Roku. I HAD my Xfinity box wired into my livingroom TV.... SUCKS compared to my Roku that can stream all my Xfinity channels from anywhere I bring my Roku plus anything else I want to watch.  In a day and age where we insist on having everything at our fingertipswhile being as portable as we are ourselves, Roku delivers again."

Got a survey from Roku, spelled out the issue and was told through e-mail someone would contact me, two weeks later it never happened. A company like this who has NO technical support for its product is CRAZY. sent the unit back and plugged in my 6 year old Roku, it works fine NOT happy with Roku"
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Neskafe,253,55,"We've had a first-gen Roku on our bedroom for 10 or so years and it still works flawlessly. On our living room TV, we've had a Fire Stick for years. The Fire has gotten almost unusable over the years, with Amazon forcing more and more proprietary apps that you can't uninstall. Navigation has gotten too complicated and slow, and so many of our apps wouldn't load or would take forever. Along with all of that, the voice recognition was practically unresponsive.  I finally decided I'd had it with the Fire. I replaced it with the Roku stick and it's like having a new TV! Navigation is responsive and easy, and app loading is FAST! The remote auto pairs with your smart TV and voice recognition is FAST and works great! Did I say it's FAST?  Don't hesitate to buy the Roku stick! It's perfect!"

When HULU upgraded their system, it no loger supported my old TV. Well, it works fine and I am not about to buy a new TV for HULU - but then I learned about this smart device and ordered it. I thought it is a one time investment so let's see what it can do! I am soooo pleasantly surprised!!! Not only can I get HULU again, but there are all kinds of free shows and channels. Plus you can get all of the things like Pure TV and FOX nations and all kinds of other stations all on this stick. It is wonderful!!! I totally love it!!!"

"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Neal,56,31,"UPDATE: the new OS update, 11, allows you to auto detect a/v delay using the phone app. Now there is no a/v lag since i use optical passthrough and a soundbar. This is excellent :)  All I can say is that this is better than the fire stick 4k and fire stick 4k max at the price point. The max doesn’t support Atmos with Disney plus at the moment (apparently a bug on disneys side) while I can confirm this Roku stick 4k supports Atmos on Netflix and Disney plus. While it’s not advertised on the box because of licensing fees, I can confirm my LG C9 receives an Atmos signal when playing compatible movies from Netflix and Disney+ at the moment. In addition this supports Dolby Vision and HDR so there really is no more they can add. This is all you need if you have a tv that supports Atmos and DV  Highly recommend!"
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Peter K.,499,235,"Got this because my old 2014 vizio smart tv has problems with 2022 streaming services.  Pros - Easy setup and use  Cons: - Roku fabric label on remote digs into your palm. I cut the label off. - Takes some getting used to when to use arrow buttons and back button. - No dvr service for free live tv. - Stick can get hot. It is not designed to run continuously. Runs cooler if you power the stick via the outlet rather than the usb slot on the tv and use the free extender rather than the hdmi slot on the tv . - Secret menus. Google ""How To Access Secret Menus On Your Roku Device"".  Update: - Remote died after 5 months. Warranty replacement would have cost me time in finding out how to get a warranty replacement + $8 in shipping + time wasted at post office + time waiting for replacement. Not worth it. Buying the remote replacement would have cost me half of what I paid for the stick + remote. Ended up getting a fire stick with voice remote as a replacement."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",lynn,803,112,"Easy, one-stop shop to access all of your streaming subscriptions on your TV!  My two main reasons for buying this:  1. We have an older plasma TV and it's not ""smart"". We've been Chromecast users for many years, and recently added AppleTV subscription but I'm an Android user. They don't make it easy to cast Apple shows to a Chromecast and we weren't having the best viewing experience by linking my MacBook to the TV via an HDMI cable. This Roku solved that problem!  2. Whenever we go out of town and have house-sitter/pet-sitters stay at our house, they can have easy access to all of our logins without leaving them our user names and passwords for everything.  I'm so disappointed in myself that I didn't do this sooner 🙈"
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Boxinghelena,939,304,"My cable/internet bill reached $250+ and that was enough to kick Comcast to the curb finally. I asked my friends so many questions before I took the plunge and convinced my husband we had to cut ties with cable and I’m now mad at myself for not going this route years ago! It was so easy to install and setup my apps. The hardest part was remembering my passwords for the apps. I also signed up for Sling streaming & Verizon’s wifi 5G cube and it feels like I still have cable while saving $150 a month. Edit: turns out that I don’t even need Sling. I only got Sling for AMC & Bravo but if you have the peacock app, they’re on it. I can’t believe I was paying $250+ for cable AND for the apps. I’m literally only paying for wifi and nine apps now."

I did alot of research on different streaming devices. Mind you I'm NOT savvy with electronics but I was so flipping impressed how easy it was to set up and watch all my favorite shows all in one. Someone made a comment on not getting YouTube on here. Not true. I got right on it. So happy with my decision. Plus you get free TV: CBS, TBS, many more. There are in purchase apps, but free trials but its cheaper that paying for cable. I highly recommend this. Now to find out how to fast forward through ads lol go premium and no ads yay!! One more thing, Get this Roku over all of them it have voice activation on the remote, volume up & down, easy to set up to the TV itself. Definitely worth the price."

"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Youhaftabekidding,246,203,"I’m a recent cord cutter. I gave a big satellite company their walking papers because I couldn’t trust anything they said. So I bought two of these for streaming. I did a lot of research between this and the other major brand but settled on this one because of its ease-of-use and because this model specifically has enhanced capability to grab an Internet signal. With one of my TVs being in the sub basement, and the router being on the second floor, I often have trouble getting an Internet signal in the sub basement. But this thing doesn’t struggle at all, the signal is amazing. These are very easy to use which is important for a fuddy-duddy like me who misses his 8-track tapes and who used to watch black-and-white TV with nothing but rabbit ears for a signal."

If you ever had a thought of ditching your cable/satellite Bill with the Fees & Taxes & bloated channel packages- (peppered with home shopping and music & channels you don't watch but pay large fees for anyway), well, I think you owe it to yourself to give Roku a try! There's plenty of free stuff (Roku, Tubi, IMDb, FSTV, ABC & CBS news, PBS, sports, weather, kids, anime, NBC Peacock &Pluto,ETC.) watch FREE until you decide you want to get premiums (ie: Netflix 9.99) Wi-Fi & any TV with HDMI activates this sturdy, inexpensive (with voice/hand control remote) Dynamite device that wll immediately be saving you upwards of $1,000 a year! And it's on sale right now. There's One 'downside' to cutting the cord: using all the free apps-you wait til your regular shows stream, some next day, to watch.-minor adjustment ;-0"
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Mark F. Stratton,249,74,"Purchased to see if our DSL Internet connection is capable of streaming adequately, and if there are enough viewing options at little or no cost. We have been stuck with satellite tv since moving to a mountainous area with little to no line of sight over the air options. Our satellite initially cost $35 and rose to well over $100 in 15 years, and with recent 2021-2022 events we need to find a way to cut additional household costs. We received the Roku stick in 3 days, and followed the simple installation instructions with no problem on our 2014 era Sony dumb tv. The picture quality is actually much better than with the satellite feed, the free (with ads) programming from the Roku Channel, Tubi, and Pluto TV is pretty amazing, and I was able to find a couple of the most local tv news stations on Roku for free. It's only been a couple of days so far, and we will have to see how the streaming holds up before we shut down the satellite for good, but in that time we have streamed from several sources, and watched 10 episodes of an old favorite series of ours. So far, so good. Happy with the purchase, and may buy another stick for the second tv. Well worth it."

We have several different brands with different menus and different remotes. By using one of my Rokus, I have the same remote for every TV with the same buttons (plus it has voice control) and all my apps are already installed and I’m logged on. (You have to do this when you first get the Roku, but then it remembers them.) When we travel, we take the Roku and we don’t have to program apps on the TVs where we are staying. And we don’t have to worry about logging out of apps. We just have to remember not to forget the Roku."

The best feature with this remote is it allows me to choose what streaming service I want to use. For example, I can say ""Top Gun"" and it will show me all streaming services that offer the movie AND the price for the movie from all of the streaming service providers. Some may be free while others ask for $3.99 to watch the same movie.  I couldn't be happier!  The voice recognition is perfect while the remote is very intuitive."

Can't believe I wasted 10 years on paying for outrageous cable when I could have been getting this for free!! No more monthly cable bills!!

If this wasn't done the picture quality was only was only ""fair"". After rebooting the quality was ""very good"". This had to be done too often in my opinion. I learned the procedure from YouTube. The Roku is really simple to navigate and the picture quality is excellent. The voice command works so well that I'll use it all the time. I'll see if it holds up over time but so far it's doing what it is advertised to do."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Nelson Johnsrud,179,44,"Reasonably good selection of free and subscription channels, but I wish Roku would settle their beef with Google over the YouTube and YouTube TV channels. I have limited options to receive local channels in my apartment building. A highway embankment next to the building blocks any attempt to receive local channels via an indoor antenna, and there is no external antenna on the building. This limits me to purchasing cable TV (which I detest), or using something like YouTube TV to stream the locals. No cost savings between these options. I may have to consider moving just so I can get free local channels again, but that’s not Roku’s problem. The Roku stick works well and has an easy to use remote. I chose not to pay extra for a second TV hookup to our cable system for our bedroom set. The Roku gives us plenty of free options for a second TV."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Maureen Bragg,10,24,"Heads up campers! It took me awhile to figure this out. My new trailer has a 12v TV in it, which uses far less electricty than AC. That's great, but it's not a smart TV. So I pull out an old Roku device I had and voila!, it works. But here's the thing... to power the old roku connects to AC power, even though it only needs 12v. So The trailer has an inverter that converts DC to AC, but it takes 10x the power. And when I'm dry camping with no power I'm super careful to minimize how much I use AC power. I won't go into the details, but I tried a number of ways to power the Roku from 12v -- nothing worked.  So I simply purchased a Roku stick which can be powered through a USB -- either directly from the TV or a USB plug. Problem solved! As long as I have a wifi signal, I can use Roku to access all of my streaming services. I'm literally a happy camper!"

Does 4k - device is smart enough to query the TV and sets up resolution and the remote control for you. Small enough to take on a trip and use in the hotel.  Cons: Make double-dog sure your email is in the country where the device is used. I went through 3 hours of troubleshooting with Paramount+ only to find out the first email address is considered out of the US, so Paramount+ would not work. Also, most of the menu options were gone. I reset the Roku, used a US email address, everything worked, and all the menu options were present."

My third fire stick started pooping out. Every app would quit and it wouldn't connect to the internet so I thought let's get a roku stick and see if it's as good as the tv and omg it is. Not one issue since the first day. It is so smooth and easy to use. Apps don't crash at all. Much better than the fire stick

HOWEVER, as nice of a product as the Apple TV is, I feel it is seriously overpriced. I wanted a second streaming device and after reading a half-dozen professional reviews, I decided to give the Roku a try.  The Roku is simple to use - and the remote much easier than the fancy one for my Apple TV. I was so impressed with the Roku that I recommended it to my daughter for her families use. She tried one and was so impressed that she has since purchased a total of 3 Roku streaming devices! Works great - priced right."

She even found some local news stations which I didnt think she would get anymore without the cable. Very impressed!"
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",JP,5,15,"The main difference from the Stick+ is that this unit has 2X the WiFi throughput on my LAN. The Stick+ had a shorter USB WiFi adapter and then a USB extension cable. This unit has a longer USB WiFi adapter cable and no extension. If you have a USB port with enough power on your TV you might find the older Stick+ cleaner to install, but you can coil up the extra USB cable length and have this newer model.  AirPlay works better with the better WiFi in these sticks.  This is the non ""plus"" version, which has the same ""voice remote with TV controls"" as the old Stick+, which does not have the headphone jack that you can get with the Roku app on your phone.  The biggest MINUS is no ""input"" button on the remote to change the TV to the ROKU HDMI port on older TVs."

So, I moved one of the old style ones to the guest bedroom and we now have the luxury of one remote for our bedroom. First world problem, I know, but it was a bit cumbersome and annoying having to fidget with 2 remotes. I love having the volume buttons built in. Functionality itself is great as the past versions have been. It works perfect and is extremely easy to setup. All thumbs up."
"Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | 流媒体设备 4K/HDR/杜比视觉,带 Roku 语音遥控器和电视控制",Samson T,19,9,"Not only does every TV in our house have these, we got one for the in-laws and they now have them on all their TV's. All programming apps are in one place. Big access to many free streaming channels ( that are usually ad supported with commercials) so there's always something to watch. Works with older HD TV's that don't have room for the ever growing number of streaming apps. Also work with Spectrum cable, all through your home WI-FI, so you don't need to rent another box (unless you have their higher tier services). Excellent if you have good household WI-FI to use anywhere without the worry of running any cable lines. Remote can control most TV's, but there are some older TV's they can't control for basic volume and off the air channeling. Also can't control the sound bars we have currently. Other than those few minor things, a great value, and a one-time price."

I love that I can now watch you tube which is a favorite. I do miss OANN channel but have so many others. Sports, gardening, fishing, religious, so many free ones. This is the best thing I've done in a long time, to leave Direct TV. I have no problem with the streaming though my son who lives in Tenn. said he did. Glad I took the chance. Would highly recommend this product."

Navigation alone makes this a far superior choice but it is also way smoother to operate. My Firesticks always slow way down no matter what I do. This is remaining quick and way easier to navigate to my content. Amazon has a very slow and crowded home screen compared to the simplicity of the Roku. Definitely a must buy for those older family or friends who aren't so tech savvy like my parents who love theirs also.

It was a difference of $110 !!!!  This really is a no brained. And hey, you’re ordering from Amazon so give it a try and make sure you get everything you like. If not, send it back."

The problem with ROKU is you have no way of knowing when the problems you’re having are, evidentially, because the device is too old or outdated. I was stunned at how flawlessly this new one works! I haven’t had to “reboot” or unplug or do any other work around since I updated. Yay! My only complaint is the I have no desire to use the voice features and there is no way to disable that annoyance."

That said, there are plenty of free services made available by ROKU including the evening news and access to PBS over the internet."

The Firesticks began defaulting to a reboot loop. I trouble-shot this problem thru Google and YouTube and could not fix them.

Then I changed to the Amazon 4K Fire Stick. It has everything I subscribe to and works pretty good, except it keeps losing the wi-fi connection. Talking to a co-worker, she told me she has a Roku and it never loses connection. So I bought this one. Sure enough, it works great and so far I have not lost my wi-fi connection. I bought it for another TV in my house upstairs. Same thing. It always connects to the wi-fi and it does not lose the connection. I still have 1 TV in my bedroom using the 4K Fire Stick. Last night I am watching it and it loses the wi-fi connection. As soon as this Roku comes down in price, I will probably be buying another one."

We also used to use the xbox to stream and that wasn't nearly as good as the Roku either. What I love about the Roku is how you can search for a movie or show you want to watch among multiple apps. I also love the voice recognition feature for searching things without typing it in. I was between this and the Amazon firestick and after researching, i'm so glad I went with the Roku. There are minimal ads on the Roku which seems to be the main complaint with the Firestick. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase!"

Both provided excellent pictures and met those expectations, however navigating the Roku set was intuitive and easy to understand. Not so the LG: too complicated and didn't make sense--at least to me and my wife (who although older are reasonably technologically savvy).  Got the Roku stick for the LG and now it works like a dream. So grateful to have that option and thrilled I don't have to rely on the LG enabled apps to find the shows and movies we want to watch. It is simply too frustrating to navigate, which is not a good feeling when you just shelled out several thousand dollars for a top line television!!!! Not to mention that the several TCL Roku enabled sets that we have in two homes work seamlessly with the same interface, remote, and smart phone enabled remote. They are a pleasure to watch and find what we want."

The visuals are great and very crisp. It does bring out the 4K and compatible with TV's features. I also tried Roku's $15 Black Friday LE model which is HD on my TV but it underperformed. It was as if I was watching videos in poor quality. I am happy with my purchase so far. Compared the HD, Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 comes with a remote that has volume controls and power on/off option. That's great. I am curious if the stick actually brings in Dolby Vision and HDR visualization on my TV screen EVEN THOUGH my TV only supports UHD. I am keeping this product and for the Black Friday deal it was a good purchase. I'd recommend it."

The other two are Roku Premiere, a model that has been discontinued by Roku (I do not see it on Roku's web page). It is has a much quicker start up and a wider range and faster wi-fi.

BUT this has blown me away. This was easy and very simple to put up. It came with plenty of options to screw into the back of the tv. Once we decided on a spot to put the tv, this was installed in less than 10 minutes. The only tools I had to provide was a drill to pre-drill the pilot holes and a socket wrench to screw in the bolts to hold it to the wall. The range of motion is awesome. The wall mount sits the tv about 4” off the wall and extends out to turn our 32” tv completely sides ways both ways."

I researched around and this was the one that matched all my criteria (extending arm, tilt, swivel, well made, easy for 1 person) with the reviews that backed it up. I read all the reviews on all of them, but paid special attention to the 1, 2 and 3 stars. That's where you find the best info before looking at the 4 & 5! This one fit the bill and I wasn't disappointed. Now, if you have basic tools -drill, ratchet socket wrench (I don't) the whole process will take you about 10-15 minutes. I don't have a stud finder (stud is an absolute must for drywall/plaster walls). But I do have a strong magnet and easily found my studs just running it over the wall, then vertically once I found the stud I wanted to use. Usually there's a stud right beside L or R of an electric plug box then 16 inches L or R of that to the next stud. I marked the nails I found in the stud in the area I wanted to attach the hanger so I didn't go in on top of one. I don't have a drill, so I hammered in a thin nail, pulled it out, then a thicker nail, pulled it out to make my 'drill hole' for the top screw (they are big and thick). I lined up the top hanger hole over my hole and marked where the bottom hole of the hanger was, then held a necklace from the top hole (I don't have a leveler) to check and make sure it was perfectly aligned. A ratchet socket wrench would have been awesome, but I don't have one, so I hand turned and turned and turned the bolts into the wall attaching the hanger (swing the hanger to the L if you are R handed). 2 seconds to attach the plate to the back of the tv. I recommend a practice run attaching the plate to the hanger BEFORE you attach it to your tv. It's easy, but then you can see how it should sit and how the screws' position holding it on in the hanger determine the tilt/no tilt. Also, move the arm around to get an idea of how easy it is to position. Pull the arm out, set the plate now attached to your tv in the notches, put in the 2 simple screws, plug in your attachments to the back of your set, position where you want it & you're done! Find your stud Drill 2 holes Attach hanger to wall Attach plate to tv Hang tv on hanger You're done. Easy peasy! They were right as advertised. 1 person can do it. Even with minimal tools!

I purchased the Pipishell because the majority of the reviews were positive and quite consistent in their critiques. When the box arrived, I was surprised at how small it was. My boyfriend put it together & he said it was really easy. I can put cat trees together fairly quickly, lol, and after looking at it, I'm pretty sure I could've done it too. **TIP-CHECK THE SCREW SIZE FOR CONNECTION TO THE BACK OF THE TV 1ST!!** Mine included 8M and 6M, I think, but my TV required a 5M. I had to go to the hardware store to buy an 8 pack of 5M (5 mm) screws, even though I only needed four, for ~$5. It was rather disappointing to my Love that he got all of that done while I was at work but couldn't have it finished when I got home because he got to the final step and didn't have the correct size screws & the hardware store was closed. When I did get the screws and mounted it, I loved it! I need to save as much space as possible in a small casita so I ditched the TV stand and gained so much space! I've had it installed about a month now and love it so much, we just ordered a Pipishell for my boyfriend's 50"" Samsung TV. FYI, this is the first time I've mounted a TV, so I have no previous comparable experiences to draw on. Bottom line, this is a strong TV mount and excellent value, in my opinion. 😷✌️🌞"

This one was a pleasant surprise as it was reasonably priced and of pretty awesome value.

I needed the full swivel ability as I need to spin the monitor it is holding on its side once in a while and this does that perfectly. Oh, and the screws which secure the mount to the wall are absurd, like you could probably mount a golf cart to your ceiling (no, not really, but these things are big boys) with them if you wanted, but that's pretty awesome, no doubt that (if you install them correctly), they're not going anywhere (ps, you shouldn't need to be told this, but it is always better to mount into a stud in your wall, seriously, find a stud.

However, I did NOT use them (I bought 2) to mount TVs to my wall. All three mirrors on my bathroom medicine cabinet had fallen off over the past few years (MDF swelled with moisture) and I needed replacements. I couldn't replace the cabinet entirely because it had lights incorporated AND it was cemented to the wall with industrial adhesive (I'd have to redo the lighting and whole wall, tasks that are well beyond my limited DIY capabilites and tools).  I saw an home improvement show where they used mirrors on a similar mount to a TV and liked it. The mirrors could be laid flat on the wall to either side of the vanity, which in the episode fronted a window, and pulled out and angled for use when needed.  Those were hard to find on my price range (frugal) so I bought the two TV mounts. I cut down a full length Thrift Store mirror to fit 2 matching Thrift Store frames of the right size (total cost $10) and used the TV mounts to attach them to my wall. I converted the actual cabinet to a display for unique-ish bottles spray painted with metallic paint.  The mirrors are working out GREAT. They were easy to install (prepping the mirrors for mounting was the most fussy bit). I was worried that the cost of the mounts indicated sub-par quality, but was very happy to be wrong about that. The mounts are VERY sturdy and so far (about a month now) are maintaining their vertical position with no slippage. They are holding up nicely to being pulled out and pushed back on a daily basis.  I highly recommend this product and may be getting more to actually mount TVs (Once I have addressed the bathroom cracked floor tiles issue).  Thank you for your attention."

They are the best mounts I've ever purchased and/or installed. So easy to setup, and the range of motion and features these provide are excellent. Sits very close to the wall when pushed all the way in, but will extend out a good ways from wall with full tilt and swivel capabilities when needed.  Installation is a breeze. I was able to get the the two mounts for the 42"" tvs installed and mounted in a total of 45 minutes by myself. For our basement TV, I was mounting an older 55"" LG model LED tv which was a beast of a tv (it's about 7-8 years old now and weighs about 50lbs). The flexibility in the arm positions made quick and easy work attaching it to the back of the old television. Mount installation to the wall was a piece of cake and took about 20 minutes, and with the help of a buddy we secured the heavy TV to the mount with no problems. It is now mounted directly above my OLED tv with zero concerns about stability, giving us a dual-tv setup perfect for watching sports.  Love these mounts and would highly recommend them to anybody."

To complicate matters, in the summer it's in the covered patio and in winter it's in the garage. It also needs to swing out of the way and (during the summer) to a less exposed place. I wanted some way to easily detach the mount and move it. While the garage has cabinets to which it could be mounted, the patio is a stucco wall. The picture shows my solution: 5/16""x3"" lag screws through a 2x4 going into metallic stucco anchors. On the wall side of the 2x4 I counter-sunk 1/4""x2"" carriage bolts on to which the mount is attached. (Yeah, I know, the drill skipped and as a result the 2x4 isn't plumb.) (Some reviewers mentioned that the lag screws that shipped with it sheared off. Because of my application I used different screws so I can't attest to the packed screws' quality.)  Overall, it feels sturdy and well made. The middle and end pivots were a little stiff so I loosened the nylon-insert locknut a little and sprayed silicone lubricant on the end. It works exactly as it should. The hardware included seems like it should be able to handle most applications.  My one complaint is that the mounting holes are a little too close to the arms so I couldn't fit wing nuts on and had to use those hex nuts you see in the picture. I'm taking a 1/16th of a star off for that."

If anything you'll definitely need a drill and a 5/32s drill bit to make the holes for the lag screws. I used an impact driver to put the mount together and to drive the lag screws into the stud but you can get away with just a screw driver and a 10mm socket on a ratchet. Also little tip you can use a strong magnet to help you find a stud. Just swipe the magnet around until it holds onto hidden drywall screw and there's your stud"

So, I went on Amazon looking for mounts. I found one! It was the least expensive mount that I had seen in my short amount of research, but it seems to be a very high manufacture quality, which I would expect when I trust a very expensive piece of hardware, as well as one of my game consoles and my dresser, to several somewhat heavy, shaped pieces of steel and metal bolts.  What you're seeing right now in my pictures, is a Samsung 2013 series F5500, 40 inch Smart TV, with a 200x200 VESA mounting pattern. As you are probably aware from reading the product description, this is about on the outer limit of what this mount can support (it says that it supports up to 42 inches, and up to 200x200). I do not detect any difficulties in the continuing stability of the mount, after I have had this mounted for about a couple weeks. There was a bit of “iffiness” until I discovered through some research that cracks and pops coming from the TV were perfectly natural parts of operation as internal casings heated and cooled down.  I have to say this, though: make sure you have the mounting bracket, which attaches directly to the TV, facing the right direction. I didn't, the first time I installed it, and was wondering why it was not flush against the TV; I took a second look at the instructions and flipped the bracket. I am happy that was solved, but in order to conceal the bolts which screwed into the VESA ports, I had to use the thickest spacers that were provided, with the thickest and longest bolts provided (M8). Everything's all flush now, and all the threadings of the bolts have caught and hold properly, like, well, an iron grip.  You might notice that the top of the mount plate which connects directly to the wall is not entirely flush with the wall, and this is due to the pilot hole I drilled not being absolutely parallel with the floor, pointing about half a millimeter or so up. I'm able to get my fingernail under that part, but that's it, and as you can see, the bottom is completely flush and there are no difficulties; no threading is lost (or will be lost, I'm feeling) on the lag screws.  While I mentioned lag screws, let me go into a little bit of a rant as to what I've noticed people complaining about on their one- or two- star reviews, that the mounts they received were not stable and extremely wobbly, in fact. As per the instructions and as is repeated multiple times in the product information, and as you see everywhere on the Internet when dealing with these things, you cannot mount this kind of thing directly into drywall! You must use a wall stud, which is a plank that was used in the building of your house, most likely! There are plastic concrete anchors provided, which you should use if you have concrete or brick walls, but they must not be used with the drywall! For my part I am supremely confident that I found the stud, avoided drilling into any live wires, and secured the lag screws (which have extremely deep and widely spaced – and thus very strong – threadings) flush against my drywall into my stud (except for what you see above).  For one of my pictures I focused on a certain bolt in the middle of the mount arm, which along with the one on the bottom which cannot be seen, is not one of those that we connect ourselves, but came that way. I identified this as the most load-bearing bolt of the whole assembly, and it remains flush, and I feel assured of its stability as well.  The only thing that I might have a particular problem with, is one that others have noted as well; and that is the method by which the mounting bracket attaches to the mount arm, via two screws. This also handles the level of tilt presented by the mount, as far down as 15° and as far up as 5° from the center. After finding the sweet spot of tilt, I tightened the screws, making sure the washers were in their places as well, and the TV has not moved since. I see no further need to adjust the tilt, so I see no problem with this in the long run.  Thank you, Pipishell, for manufacturing this amazing tool which helps me to expand my entertainment options in my bedroom! I look forward to watching my TV mounted for years and years to come!  EDIT 3-21-2022: A year and a couple months out, and still no issues! Pipishell makes some great products, gotta say! In a few months I must replace this aging TV, however, as it has developed a dark spot in its LEDs in the upper left. I have little doubt that, because I'll be using a TV of the same size and mounting standard (this one, unless they run all the way out of stock by the time I'm ready to purchase it, in which case I'll find another: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TTF3HJ3/ ), this mount will give me no problems.  Thank you again, Pipishell! Again highly recommended!"

I mean it often rings true that you get what you pay for. Nonetheless I went ahead and decided to give this a try. Worst case I was out very little money but best case...was big savings over what I would usually get.  So, I used this to install a 27"" TV to a bedroom wall for gaming purposes. If you've ever installed a bracket for a tv; this one you could almost do without even having to read the directions (I do recommend reading them though). Installation was quick and easy. I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy this was and the range of motion it provided. I was so pleased that I bought another one for a 32"" TV we have in our workout room.  Please keep in mind that 32"" was the largest tv we used for this. Both TVs were not heavy by any means. If you are looking to mount something that size or smaller, I highly recommend. I would suggest looking for other reviews that mention larger size TVs. It's not that I don't think this would work. It's just that I don't want you to take MY word for it since I didn't use it for something larger than a 32""."

The installation beyond that wasn't terrible. I recommend taking off the arm, since that creates extra weight and needs to be out of the way to make your marks for drilling. I didn't use the included drywall anchors, so I can't comment on those. It did come with all of the hardware needed to mount a TV, including several screw sets and sizes for the TV to install to the mount plate.  Make sure you have a small magnetic level available, otherwise you'll need a friend. Without a magnetic level, you'll need 3 hands, or more steps. I had a TV stand once that came with a little magnetic level and it's been a wonder in my house since then. It came in handy on this install.  Once the base is hung, put the arm back on and tighten it up again. If you don't take off the arm, you'll still need to loosen the bolts on the arm just a little to allow the TV to swing easier. The arm is really tight and a smaller TV just doesn't have the weight or the leverage to move the arm without loosening it a bit.  Other than a couple quirks for the installation, it worked great and holds up the TV just fine."

It’s rated for up to a 32” tv (I used it for a 32” Samsung LCD ~30-40 lbs). It is strong enough to hold the tv but it is definitely at max capacity as far as size and weight for this size tv. I wouldn’t recommend going over a size 28” for this mount. Installation: Package has a wide variety of hardware for install. Pretty simple installing the mounting bracket to your tv. Extensions for the bracket are easy, just line the holes up with the indentions. Wall mounting of the articulation...be sure you place the mount on a stud. The great thing about this is if you are off on your mount being flush the articulating arm has a tilt so you can adjust it by hand once the tv is hung. The only downfall I found to installation was when it came to hanging the tv. You will need a ladder to lift and look over the top. The hangers are small and require some accuracy to catch them. You will need to hold the tv against your body while you install the 2 tilt screws. The articulation and tilt have a wide range of motion, but I would not recommend this mount if this is something you will utilize on a regular basis as the durability of this mount would not hold up to this type of regular use in my opinion."

It works exactly as advertised, seems to be well built, and it is fairly easy to install. It took me about half an hour to install it, from unpacking to TV mounting, and I have no complaints. If you’re mounting it into a wall stud, as recommended, you should be prepared to drill pilot holes and it would also be helpful to have a socket wrench handy for the lag bolts. The TV I mounted on this unit do not have mounting screws, so I was a bit concerned that I would run into problems finding screws that fit. Not a problem! The unit comes package with a variety of mounting screws, and I had no trouble finding a set that fit my TV."

For the price point these mounts are a steal. They’re versatile and come with every single kind of screw, washer, nut, vesa plate and vesa adapter, concrete screws, etc. Everything! I’ve installed lord knows how many and they are a breeze to install. I don’t use the instructions anymore but when I did the instructions were very well written. I highly recommend.

It is not enormous or bulky, so I can put the tv flat to the wall pretty well. I am not a very large person, so to angle it more toward one side of the room, I can easily pull it out and turn it toward that side. To return it to original position is also easy.  I move the tv at least once a day, and for the month and a half I've had it installed, it has been holding steady. It does not have up/down tilt, only a side-to-side adjustment, so if you are looking for more full-motion, this one is not. It is smooth, and functions great for the price - I was expecting a flimsy arm, but it is quite solid.  I recommend."

They give you all the hardware you will need and they designed in a way to accommodate all screw patterns on most tv's. Directions are a little confusing but I figured it out. Just in the way to construct the back plate to attach to your tv, mine had a wider pattern requiring the extension pieces, yours may not require the extension brackets that are included, in that case it will be even easier to install. I searched for the main screw to attach the bracket to the extension arm when I finally figured out it was screwed in to the bracket attachment instead of thrown in with the included hardware. That was frustrating for about 10 minutes, lol. Solid when installed, a fair price and they include everything you need, what more can i say."

The 1st was for an older (heavier) Samsung 32"" TV, and the 2nd for a lightweight 24"" Acer computer monitor. Both were mounted on outside walls (concrete block construction). The installation kit contains a HUGE variety of mounting hardware, including adapters for the common 75mm, 100mm, and 200mm VESA screw-on mounting plates and various sizes of bolts and anchors. I used the included concrete anchors and lag bolts to mount both screens. In both cases the easy installation took less than 20 minutes with the included step-by-step instructions. (You will need a 3/8"" concrete drill bit for mounting to concrete walls.) I don't know how they can sell such a quality mount for such a bargain price. The mount for the larger TV has no problem supporting the near-30 pound weight of that screen. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this nicely- configured wall mount to anyone, and I would definitely buy it again."

I chose this bracket because we need to adjust the angle of the tv frequently for workouts or watching shows, and the range of motion is exactly what we needed. We typically move it from the flat-to-the-wall position to about a 30 degree angle from the wall, and it is always a satisfyingly snug and secure maneuver.  I definitely recommend reading the mounting instructions a couple times. It is easy to switch up some steps (thankfully I got it on the first try, but I had a couple close calls). This comes with several different bolt and spacer sizes to fit just about any tv.  We are very happy with the purchase, and the price was incredible!"

I was able to use this on my 48"" Sony TV (~23 lbs, 200x200 vesa) and it seems to work pretty well. I had to set the tension bolt really tight though to prevent it from being too tippy one way or the other. I would caution anyone going above the 42"" limit the product states, I can definitely tell I am pushing it's limits ergonomically (weight-wise it seems fine since it's rated for over 40 lbs).  Otherwise it works really well and gives me good range of motion! The lag screws are pretty long and hold it in place very well. Very easy instructions and setup.

One thing about wall mounts, especially those with 2 mounting holes, your chances of having a wall stud right where you need it is slim. The last two I installed I had to use a piece of solid oak attached to the wall and then attach the mount to the oak. Its very sturdy but took a lot more time to install. And if you are really concerned about centering the TV on a wall, be careful because when the bracket is folded against the wall the piece that is centered on the back of the TV is not exactly centered on the piece that attaches to the wall. So centering the wall piece will make your TV just slightly off center."

One small hint from someone who doesn't read instructions: When hanging the TV on it, turn the mount upside down and put the TV on it upside down. THEN put the screws in between the TV plate and the mount, turn it over, adjust and tighten screws. At first I was disappointed that I couldn't just hang the TV on it before getting the screws to tighten it down (because the TV would fall off) but then I discovered how to do it.

For YOU it should only take about 5 minutes since you'll probably have your screwgun charged before you start (and he didn't :P)  So in general, very affordable and I couldn't ask for more! Should we want to mount another TV, I'd re-buy!"

I installed this in my art studio/office/workout room/den area. The whole point was for it to be used for all functions of this very large long room. I am able to adjust and move this mount all over the place so it can be seen from every use and function of the room that I need. It did come with enough parts to be a bit intimidating (I had a ton of leftovers), but it was still super easy. My TV ended up coming with the screws needed to use with a mount so I didn't really need most of the screws that came with the mount. However, in the end it comes with enough equipment to go with any TV you have."

He has a 32 inch smart Vizio and it has been sitting on his dresser. This mount is perfect. It was some trial and error as you can see lol just from lack of experience! But overall I love it I don’t need to pull it out but for the price and the fact I live in an apartment and will need to remove it later I wanted something I can easily get behind.

I'm a handy woman so attaching the VESPA to the back of my flatscreen, I had to just figure out what screw size to use. You do need a drill to attach the wall mount part. My son did that for me. Make sure you use the stud in wall. It takes 2 to hang the flatscreen though. One to hold the TV in place, the other to attach the 2 screws. The TV swivels left and right. Also into the wall, or pull it out. It's sturdy and strong. My first wall mount. I love it. No need for a more expensive one. I did read several reviews for several mounts. This mount has thousands of reviews. I love it. Get this one. You won't be sorry."

For starters the price is FABULOUS…the quality of the mount is amazing, the tv swivels easily, pulls out away from the wall without any issues and then easily tilts upwards and downwards. As you can see from my picture the tv pulls out a very good distance from the wall!

I guess you may have a tv that has funky size screws needed to mount, but this package provides like 3 size mounting screws and it worked for me. Used this on a 24” samsung tv and it worked great. The lag screws that go into the wall are quite long and thick, so a decent drill will be needed. The maneuverability of the mount is “tight” as in it doesn’t loosey goosey get into positions which is good for stability in your desired spot."

You'll need a drill and Phillips head screwdriver for sure. If the idea of locating a stud scares you, you can get a stud finder that'll let you know where you can drill with support.

It was a little hard finding a stud in my textured walls but when I definitely found one it was crazy easy to install this thing. It has an attachable bracket for TVs with the screw holes farther spaced out but for my tv I didn't need it, just the regular distance I think 200mm? Was fine. I did have to buy a drill bit to predrill my holes before putting the screws, I was worried about using those ancors cause they seemed confusing in the video but the ancors are for brick and concrete not wooden studs so I didn't have to use those. For the first week the hinges were kind of stuff, but they really loosened up after a bit. I believe I've owned it 2 months already. There's nowhere in my room I could sit and not be comfortable watching TV, I use it for my PC, watching TV with my Apple TV, playing clone hero, I have it set up right in front of my EDrums so that's very convenient.

I used it to hang a 32 inch tv in my wife's craft room. Now she has more space on top the dresser and with the ability to swing out and adjust the angle she can be working in any part of the room and watch her youtube or favorite shows.  Installation was a breeze........ Find stud, pre-drill and screw mount to wall. I then attached the mounts to the back of the TV, hung it on the mount and installed the bolts to hold tv in place. Bought a longer power cord for the tv and a longer DVI cord for the firestick. Plugged in and done!! Next is to run the cords in the wall to hide them.  As for the mount I find it to be solid and stays in any position we put it in. It is a little stiff but that will wear in to be smoother which I'd rather have. All my other TV's are a lot bigger and on different mounts but I would totally buy this again if we needed a smaller tv somewhere else in the house. I would totally recommend this product!!

IMPORTANT: If you want some peace of mind, want to save some time, and effort, please buy some Driller Toggle Drywall Screws by Cobra to mount this. Photos attached of these. You can find these at Home Depot and I am sure online. But the wonderful thing about these is you do not have to find a stud to mount. Each screw holds 110 lbs. This is overkill but for your expensive tv, this is the peace of mind. My condo has some pretty thick metal studs and that just makes it difficult.

Wall mounts for Samsung TV's are a little more challenging because many do not come with compatible bolts. This mount does comes with bolts compatible for a series of different manufacturers including Samsung and the 8000 Series 65in 2018 model. That saved me a trip to the local hardware store. Because the back of the TV is curved I had to fiddle with the brackets to make sure they were snug and secure them with some long spacers that came with the TV and a couple thin spacers that come with the mount. Securing the brackets was the most challenging part but really not that bad. Just take your time and make sure you do it right. Securing the mount to the wall is pretty easy once you get it level. A drill and a socket set and you are good to go. Once it is in a couple studs it is very secure and that TV is not going anywhere. I also paired this mount with the PowerBridge ONE-CK Recessed In-Wall Cable Management System to hide the wires which also works great. Very happy with this mount and would buy again.

When assembling, make sure to push both sides together so they are both lined up a perfectly horizontal. When adjusting the tilt mechanism, you'll want to use something as a gauge so both sides are tilted exactly the same. Mounting the wall mount is easy, but make sure to use a stud finder to locate the center of the studs so the lag bolts can grip securely. There's a little room for vertical play in the mounting slots so you'll be able to fine tune the leveling to some extent. You'll also be able to slide your TV left and right a little to get it centered. BTW, the package include an HDMI cable and a level. I personally wouldn't trust either."

The tilt option and the quick release pull downs are easy to use. The quick release is a great safety assurance that no one is able to accidently lift the bottom of the TV away from the wall. But should you need to do so, each release is quickly accessed by hand and because the TV is a 55"" unit, it hides the release pull down ribbons very well.

I have two mounts of another more expressive brand that were both installed by a professional. The other brand cost $150.00 each and supports up 150 lbs.

This mount is very sturdy and offers quick disconnect pull straps to easily remove the TV from the mount if needed.  Attaching this mount to the wall was very easy with the aid of the included leveler. Make sure to find the studs in the wall with a stud finder. For additional peace of mind, use a magnetic stud finder in addition to the traditional one to locate the nails in the studs. There is nothing worse than discovering a metal nail in a spot where you need to screw in your last bolt.  Surprisingly, I was able to use this mount for a 32 inch Vizio TV! It fits in the center of the mount snugly but it fits! I have bought two of these mounts to hang up two TV's in the bedrooms (the 32 inch and a 50 inch). I did the mounting and wire/wall work myself. The results came out very nice combined with this mount! If I had more rooms I would buy more of these mounts to hang TV's on.

These are the best and easiest TV mounts that I have installed. I have now installed 14 of these mounts. I like that they are thin and keep the TV close to the wall. They allow plenty of tilt in the TV. They came with everything needed to install (including a cute little magnetic level) :). I don't use them but at least they come with it. I now have a bucket of these little levels if anyone needs one. So far, It has come with every bolt/bushing needed for every TV VESA setup I have used. I have used this mount for Sony, Samsung, Vizio, LG, TCL, Hisense, and yes even an Insignia. Sizes from 40 to 75 inches (Yes, I said 75""). I don't know why the 70"" limit. The LG 75"" fits great on them. So far they have spread across all stud setups. Haven't had a need to use a molly yet because there are so many mounting holes on the base. If I have one complaint to be nit picky... the straps on the tv vesa mounts for the latches are too long. In order to hide them after mounting a TV, you need to tie them up. Forget using the adjusting slide, it doesnt get them short enough. Before mounting the TV I have learned to use a wire tie to hold them up and then put TV on wall. I can mount a TV now in about 15-20 minutes with these mounts. But of course I've done few now. I would give yourself about 40-45 minutes first time.  I am very confident that anyone can mount a TV with this mount. Its that simple. 2 Screws to assemble the back plate. 4 lags to mount plate to wall. 4 bolts for TV VESA. Lift it up and put it on the bracket. Push slightly on bottom of tv till you here it click in place. Than you can slide it on the mount right or left to tweak it where you want. Done."

Both of them seemed very consistently machined, but there is enough play in the slots to adjust a little bit to make up for any small differences. Once the plate was bolted to the wall the rest snapped together very easily. My only gripes about it are the adjustment for the tilt on the mount. This needs to be done without the tv being on the wall (which means if you dont like the angle you need to take the tv back off of the plate on the wall). The other issue it that there aren't any marks on the adjustment slot so it can be tricky to get both sides the same since there are two adjustments that are independent of each other. These are minor issues especially considering the price. The mount also comes with an HDMI cable and a small level. Some people that reviewed said that they wouldn't trust them. I compared the included level with my normal one and it's definitely a cheap level but did its job well enough, I used it while mounting mine up just to see and got a good result. The HDMI cable is braided and looks nice but I cant speak to the quality of it. Overall for the price I would definitely reccomend it if you only need left to right and tilt adjustments"

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU USE YOUR OWN TRUSTED LEVEL! The small levels that come with these kits are not reliable.  The most time consuming part of the whole process was marking my measurements and finding the studs. 4 sturdy lag bolts were included to mount the bracket. Once mounted, the TV is easily attached and locked on with the pull straps. Some folks don't like that the straps hang down. You can tape them up if its a big deal but they are way easier to use than the alternative allen screw style. It takes mere seconds to hang or remove the TV. This mount is very adjustable. Besides tilt angle, you can also slide the TV left or right a few inches and you can remount the arm hangers up or down for height too.

These things are amazing. the instructions are easy, mounting is easy and in comes with so many different options to ensure it will work on basically any TV. The TCL I purchased has a weird bulge that made fitting this a bit awkward compared to my other TV, but the spacers made them a non issue.  I HIGHLY recommend using carpenters tape (the blue tape) to outline where you want your TV, Soundbar, etc. before you make holes on your walls as once you do that you will most likely adjust it after visually seeing the Outline. While this has nothing to do with the product, it will make your mounting life so much easier. I know as we did not do that for the first/previous one we did."

We were mounting a 65"" Samsung UHDTV and it needed the longest M8 screws and additional washers and it fitted the highest and lowest holes on the brackets that go on the back of the TV. The spirit level that was included was not used as it was out of level when checked on a flat surface (just swing it through 180 and the bubble was not the same). The holes for the lag screws to hold it to the wall studs needed a 7/32"" drill and it still took a hex ratchet wrench and a strong arm to get them fully home. It was a good job that I connected the HDMI cables and the optical cable before mounting on the wall as they are almost inaccessible as the TV is very close to the wall. Two small release straps are provided for the bottom latches but they were just too short to be reached so we extended them by looping string through the straps. It was quite easy to tuck the excess string out of the way so nothing showed. The mounting bracket allows the TV to slide left and right for final positioning which helped as the studs were not in the best position between two large bookcases. Great praise for the well thought out unit and all of the fixings and great instructions."

And they have always cost me easily well over $100. You figure that it is what it is, I will have the mount forever now, well... I recently moved into a new home and the wall mounts I spend big money on do not have the proper spacing for the studs in our new place! they were too small! and I was not about to mount plywood and do all kinds of extra work just to get my TV on the wall... $30, and has PLENTY of space for literally any stud situation you might run into. After having to buy all new wall mounts for all my TV sets, I absolutely regret initially spending way more money.  Range of motion was the only rating to not get a 5 star. That is mostly because of the obvious ""flaw"" with the product. It is meant to be more flush to the wall so there clearly will be less range of motion. This is not a negative thing, as I understood this when purchasing the product. The 3 stars given reflect that its range of motion is 3 out of 5. It has enough, and that's pretty much it. Do not expect this to pull off crazy viewing angles for you TV. I mounted a 65in TV, maybe if you mount something smaller you could get more tilt on it as there is less TV restricting the downward tilt. If you need more tilt down, you probably shouldn't be hanging your TV so high. STOP HANGING YOUR TV SO HIGH OVER THE FIRE PLACE THAT IS NOT A PROPER VIEWING ANGLE!!"

We originally bought this big beefy one that had full range of motion for a large tv but decided we did not need all that so we sent back that $200 mount for this much much cheaper one and it does its job great. I was shocked how much lighter and less material there was than the other one but I am fully confident in this mount. We have it above a fire insert in our house holding a 65"" Samsung. Bolts it comes with for the tv are great. It comes with a variety of spacers and washers and bolts to ensure it will fit your tv hole depth and the spacers allow you to mix and match to customize the mount fit to your tv. Works well, not worried about that tv at all. Range of motion is low but that is what it is designed to be, it can tilt some but we have it up on the wall so the natural down tilt angle it provides is perfect. We dont ever need to push it flat up against the wall so that is not needed. Given the metal was not wide enough to span three studs, we had to use a thin piece of wood to bolt to the studs and then bolt the mount to the wood but looks good, I trust it, super easy to set up. Once the base is mounted and the backs are on the tv, literally all you do is set it on the mount and it locks in. No more than two people needed, although three would be smart if you have anything bigger than 65"". GREAT MOUNT."

I'm pretty satisfied with it. Lots of flexibility with spacers, holes, and bolts. Seems plenty sturdy for my set.  The only slight ""gotcha"" to be aware of is if you try to set the tilt angle before hanging it on the wall, the latches on the bottom will not engage. It has to be almost completely straight vertical before they will clear the bottom rail and properly lock in place. You can tilt it after its hanging on the wall though. The trick is to tighten the bolts to where they are just tight enough to keep it from moving by itself, but not to tight to prevent movement with a firm pull.  Fortunately I realized this before I hoisted the set in place the first time so no big deal. You can also tighten them after you have it in the desired position, but there isn't much room to get your hand in behind the set once it's mounted so I chose to pre-adjust them. If you had a really long Allen wrench it might be easier, but I didn't.  All in all a decent mount for the money. Dinged one star because the mounting quirk may trip some people up. They could have altered the design a little to eliminate that problem."

The wall mount itself is lightweight but sturdy enough to hold this TV very securely. The instructions are easy to follow but it is important to find the studs behind your wall to get a solid attachment. The mount allows for easy lateral adjustment once your TV is mounted so you can adjust its position on the wall if needed. There are also spacers included if you need to bring the TV further from the wall to allow for cable access or just to level the mount against the back. The tilt mechanism allows upto 8 degrees but at most recommended heights, you may not need any tilt at all. It's easy to lock the tilt mechanism to set it at zero degrees. The kit does come with a bubble level but I would check it before trusting it's accuracy. The one with this kit was way off level so didn't end up using it. It's also worth adjusting the bracket release straps before attaching the TV so that they're not visible behind the bottom of the TV. Overall still an excellent mount for the price!"

DAVIS,2734,219,"The very first things that impressed me on this TV mount was the price and the ultra fast delivery. But, seeing the product was a real wow!  For our TV wall installation, I wanted to make certain that wall mount would include 24"" on centers mounting-and it does. When opening the box, it was determined that was well made. It was also very simple to put together and mount to the wall.  There is a small level included in the package. Previous experience has educated me that it is not sufficient for the task. What I do is locate the studs in the area I plan to do the mounting, then mark them with small pieces of masking tape at the height it will be mounted. I then take a finishing nail to locate the center of one stud. Proceeding to the next stud, I use a tape measure and another small piece of masking tape. Then measuring up from the floor or down from the ceiling, I use masking tape at the height chosen, the mark for the height on the tape. When the height and widths align, I again use a finishing nail to make certain it is on a stud. Checking all of the measurements for the last time, I drill the pilot holes at the top, drive in the lag screw and leave them slightly loose. The the bottom holes are drilled and lag screw inserted slightly loose. Then, making certain the mount is in the proper wall position, I seat each lag screw. The base plate of this mount is 25"" and very solid in place. The Vesa spacing will allow for the TV to move either way off center to get the proper wall placement of the TV.  The next step is the most important because you do not want to damage/destroy your TV. There are several different bolt lengths and spacers included for mounting the TV to the hangers. Select the proper bolts and spacers by hand tightening to get the proper depth, then securely attach the hangers to the TV. Without touching the screen, the TV and be positioned on the wall bracket. This is best done with two people. The angle can be set either before or after the TV is in place. Once the TV mounts are seated in the top track, the lower locking mechanisms can be lock it on the lower track. Note, there are stops on either end of the wall mount to  If the TV is in the bedroom, the TV can be mounted high and the set tilted to the max 15 degrees. Depending on screen size, we calculate a large screen TV 7"" from the ceiling to the top of the TV. Smaller screens 9""-10"". When propped up in bed, the TV is positioned to alleviate eye strain and neck pain.  We chose this mount for a 49"" LED TV and there is no doubt it will hold up to the task."

A very small level is provided, but you will need a longer one; probably a foot long or longer. Additionally, you'll need a stud-finder, a socket set, and a good drill along with a 1/8 drill bit to drill pilot holes. The bracket that attaches to the TV has several adjustments up and down, in case you don't get the wall-mount assembly positioned exactly halfway between the mantle and the ceiling. Unfortunately, the only level adjustment you can make once the lag bolts are in the wall is within the bolt hole on the bracket, so make absolutely sure the wall-mount assembly is level, or it will bother you, especially with a large TV.  There are several bolts and spacers included to mount the TV to the TV bracket hangers, but I could not find the correct combination to fit my set, so had to make a trip to the hardware store to get the correct size bolts. I don't consider this a negative, as every TV I have previously purchased came with the correct bolts, so I was surprised when I didn't find them included.  Oh, and by the way...better plan on this being a two-man job, if you are mounting a TV set larger than 55"".

The wall plate comes in two pieces and you screw the right side rails to the center bracket. This could be a problem for some. The release pulls are adjustable in length to help hide them behind smaller tv’s. I am using this in a rental unit and found it to be quality substantial enough for light commercial action.  Works great for a flush mount on a very thin led backlit 55” tv.  Instructions make it clear that you should not mount the tv at the furthest couple inches of the wall mount. I thought that it was odd the rail extends all the way to the end and would have engineered it to end a couple inches before the last mount. In reality, it should not matter as someone with 16” studs and a TV that is 400mm VESA will still have substantial weight on the other screws. What may be more concerning is a heavy 100mm wide VESA on the far end over one pair of screw holes and levering the other screw holes. I don’t think you would see a failure, but the instructions state not to mount at the end of the rail. It is worth measuring your wall in advance with a copy of the instructions from online and seeing if the mount width will work on your wall."

The hardest part was finding the stud. The kit includes everything you need to install the bracket to the wall and also to install your TV. My studs were 16"" center to center and due to their location my TV does not sit right in the center of this 24"" mount but is slightly to one side. I share this with you to illustrate that not being centered is not a show stopper. The instructions included provide instructions to test the mount prior to installing the TV. I literally hung on it with all my weight and it felt very very secure. The massive lag bolts are definitely to thank. Be sure to drill pilot holes. One hiccup was that I was unable to use my impact driver as the head on the lag bolt was 12mm. Luckily I had a socket wrench and was able to torque them down manually. Apart for that no special tools are needed, just make sure you have a stud finder, a pencil, screwdrivers and a level. I did also use a magnet to help me locate studs and also figure out where the center of the stud might be. My only nit picky complaint would be that the vertical brackets mounted on the TV doesn't tightly clasp onto the horizontal bracket mounted on the wall allowing for some side to side movement if nudged. I don't think the TV would slide all the way off thr mount though. If there is a way to tighten this fit I haven't yet discovered it. Secondly the two loops that did engage the clasps hang under the TV but my wife was able to tie them up and hide them with a little effort. I hope this review helps you, I would buy this again it's really solid"

Find your studs, find your center, see where this mount will sit based on those measurements, buy drywall anchors ahead of time, USE YOUR OWN LEVEL, and if you are fishing wires through the wall prepare for that also. If you do your homework first, installing this mount takes all of 10 minutes. As this is a wider mount, you will likely be able to go across two studs, which makes this installation more sound. Just make sure you find the center of your stud! The back of my Samsung TV is curved. It came with the spacers needed for Wall mount, however, I still had to use the 250mm spacers (provided) to make the screws sit flush. Just be prepared to try a couple of different configurations to ensure that you have the right length screws, and that there's no space left between the head of the screw after screwing in all the way.  Other Thoughts: This wall mount is well made. It is not my first from this vendor, and won't be my last if I need another wall mount. Know that tilting has to be configured ahead of time. It's not something you can do once the TV is mounted. If you want a mount who's tilt you can adjust on the fly, you'll need to get a different mount. Most people don't move their TVs after they're mounted anyway, so take that into consideration. Cost vs. Usability.

It has a solid and sturdy frame that “feels” like it could certainly hold the advertised weight.  A very nice feature is the straps on the bottom of the mounts that lock the TV in to place and make it very easy to dismount it if you need to access the TV. The bracket on the back of the TV has hooks both on the top and the bottom that connect directly to the frame you mount on your wall. You hook the top brackets into place then push the bottom onto the frame and they click into place. Instead of having to reach behind the TV it has to pull straps that will unlock the bottom latches and allow you to lift the TV off the wall mount. Very well thought out and very user friendly.  This is absolutely a value for the price and will definitely be purchasing again if we have a need for any additional mounts.

Really easy because once we got it installed, it was so close to the wall that we couldn't get the TV or cable box plugged in. You milage may vary, but we don't have the recessed plug box behind the TV. Fortunately, we were able to use the provided spaces to extend the brackets out a bit and then everything fit perfectly.

It came with a nice wall template which made it especially easy to drill the holes for the mounting screws in the wall. It even came with a nice HDMI cable which was totally unexpected (but appreciated) which was almost worth the cost of the bracket itself.

I've installed number of TV's and familiar with proper install including routing the wires behind the dry wall but for this install I opted not to do so.  You will either need a stud finder if not a good magnet that has 60 lb pull or more. IMO the magnet is far more accurate and easy to find studs as often times either you'll see a drywall with ever so slight dimple from the drywall screw. It'll be either 16"" or 24"" apart to the center of the stud (goes vertical if you're not familiar with the studs).  After finding the studs make sure to use a level (your own 3 foot or longer helps) to mount the main support level.  Other than that, the install is a breeze. If your TV does need any spacers this job could really done in 10-15 minutes. A drill to make pilot hole and either a good impact wrench or regular socket wrench should do the job.

They provide several types of VESA bolts to fit many different TV mounting holes. They also provide spacers, washers and lag bolts. Since I was attaching a 50"" Plasma weighing about 75 lbs on a metal studded wall I bought 6 snap wall toggle anchors as was recommended on a YouTube about mounting on a metal studded wall. The ones I got were from Home Depot and 4 of the six broke while inserting into the drilled hole. Fortunately I have standard 3/16"" toggle bolts. While harder to install they worked much better and more secure so if going into metal studs I recommend standard toggle bolts. Be sure to find the center of the stud by using a magnet and nailing on both sides of the studs to find the center. Back to the mount; it is really well designed and strong.

If you're a little bit handy you should be able to do this without a professional installer for TVs up to 55-65"" if you have a drill, a ratchet set and some time (and someone to help you hold things steady and pick the TV up for the final bit. For anyone with a Samsung UN55ju6500 (I believe this is the 2015 Samsung model), here's a tip: - You won't need spacers, but you should note that the plastic washer looks like it won't fit the M8 screw, but the little plastic part in the middle pops out to fit the larger width M8. - You will need the shorter length M8 screws that come with the kit, not the longest ones. Use those in conjunction with the plastic washers with the center popped out. It took me a while to figure out the right configuration for the brackets on the back of the TV. But for the Samsung UN55ju6500, everything you need is included in the box."

This comes with multiple spacers, multiple screws, and it’s entirely metal. I installed myself on a 55” tv and hung it without a problem. You have to attach to the studs in the wall. Drywall attachment won’t do. Also, if your wood screws are too long depending on how the stud is framed, you can always use a spacer or go get comparable screws with shorter lengths. The point is you must attach to the wood studs in the wall.  The thing even comes with a mini level and a thick paper template for placement. attaching to the back of the tv was east and brackets fit right on. 10/10 will buy for my 65” samsung soon.

We have 5 TV in the home, and recently added this one for our 70in TV. We like it because it's simple to install, the mounting hardware is easy to screw in and will work with standard 16in studs. Once the brackets are installed to TV and wall, its super simple to mount. You just hang the TV from the top portion of the bracket and then pull the cord to lock in the bottom. Since mounting, we have moved the TV off that wall about 4 or 5 times quickly and easily to paint or add shelving - each time it was effortless to reinstall. There is also just enough space on the back of the TV to see where to plug in everything - but I do advise plugging in all devices and connectors TO THE TV first if you can before mounting - then attach them to the cable box/surround sound or other devices after you hang the TV."

The mount has great maneuverability to get the perfect angle for viewing regardless of the viewing distance, and we use this TV specifically while workouts, so the ability to bring it to standing eye level is perfect for the application. It includes Velcro wire ties, which is a cool addition, and I've impressed with the overall build quality. Only note is that, obviously, make sure you're mounting this to stud in the wall to properly hold a heavy TV, or any TV for that matter.

My husband and I are ill-equipped for most of what life throws at us but mounting a tv wasn’t one of them thanks to this company and their product.  Do not open the instructions until after you’ve taken the other stuff out otherwise you’ll FREAK OUT like I did because I was confused and overwhelmed but that was MY fault. The company just wants everyone to have a universal mount and my Ill prepared self didn’t realize that of course they had to give multiple instructions for that to be possible.  SO STAY CALM.  They even have the big bolts with the option to use a screw driver to drive them into the wall instead of just a wrench.  Brilliant.

The instructions were detailed and clear, and the mounting system came with all kinds of fasteners and spacers for just about any kind of TV model adaptation. A spirit level is included in the kit, which was a really nice touch! just the right size for conveniently ensuring that the mount is absolutely level. The spring loaded bottom clips with pull tabs are a great idea!  The instructions stress to ONLY use the lag bolts into wooden studs, or a concrete wall. They specifically state to NOT use drywall anchors, and I can heartily agree with their warnings. The lag bolts were very easy to use, and I have had plenty of experience with drywall anchors, both toggle bolts and other kind of in-drywall anchors eventually cutting through or working out of the wall over the years and dumping stuff on the floor. Vibrations in the house eventually degrade just about any drywall anchor connection that is under significant static load.  So, follow the instructions and enjoy your really great wall mount!"

I assumed that it would need to be returned snd a real mount ordered as it was 20% the regular price point for such mounts. Was I ever wrong. I am hard to please. I would rather go without than to own junk and modern manufacturing leaves a lot to be desired. Not this mount. Heavy gauge metal. Basically every screw you might need for every major brand individually sealed and labeled?!? Plastic grommets and washers to improve stability depending on style of TV.... also separated and labeled!!?? Instructions were simple and properly labeled with good illustrations! I cannot believe they did this for under $30. It is manufactured with a higher quality and better organization that anything I have purchased in a long time. Even came with Lag Bolts to mount into studs instead of undersized screws! GET IT!!!! You will be impressed.

The provided level and HDMI cable were an added plus. Installation was easy and seamless our new 50"" mounted up with no problems. Other reviews have mentioned that the screws used to attach the two sides of the mounting plate together were too big for the threaded holes. This is due to paint in the threads of the plate. Once you get the screws started they go in no problem. The only complaint I have is that it is nearly impossible to tighten the set screws holing the TV at an angle due to how close the TV is to the wall.  Anyway, a great bracket at a fair price."

I originally bought a wall mount from Best Buy that I was ultimately unable to make work because it did not have the right bolts and adapters to fit the back of my new TV.  After researching a number of wall mounts, I chose this one and couldn’t be more pleased. It’s sturdy, well designed, easy to install on the wall. And it came with all the possible bolts and adapters that you need for various TVs. The instructions also were clear and easy to follow. One person can easily install this by themselves although it does take two people to hang the TV on to it.  The mount makes it easy to adjust the angle of the TV, so you can hang it higher up on the wall and angle it down, to reduce the glare from nearby windows. It also features a well-designed latching system, with straps that are easy to reach from behind the TV set. Best of all, this unit was 1/3 of the price of what was a less well-designed and inferior product that I got at Best Buy when I bought my TV. I give this product two, big, thumbs up"

I was able to compinsate for this by just sliding the tv on the mount to the left and it centered it where I wanted it.  The instructions call for a socket wrench, and i would HIGHLY recommend this.

I had to put the spacers on just give enough room for my cords behind the screen. Sadly I had to switch from a cantilever model because your youngest would constantly move the TV. I gave it one star for range of motion because there isn't any. In this case that's exactly what you want. Just the 8° of tilt. Beyond that it's 5 star for cost easy of use.

They really made it simple and easy, and there's videos on You Tube on how to do it if you're more of a visual person. I would say the only downside is that the range of motion isn't much. Once you mount the TV, you can tilt it downward a bit, but that's it. You can't turn it left or right and it won't extend outward either. I'm OK with it, but other folks might be looking for more. Keep that in mind when purchasing this item."

I was wrong on this one. I gave installation 4 stars because if you’re familiar with DIY it isn’t bad at all, but you do have to have some tools to mount properly. This unit is extremely robust. The lag screws they included in the unit were massive, so much so I was worried about splitting the studs but they worked well with some pilot holes. My stud locations didn’t allow me the ability to center this unit where I wanted the tv to sit. But because it is so insanely sturdy, I was able to hang my tv entirely on the left half of the mount to get it centered. The attaching mechanism is strong and pretty simple to use. The directions are pretty straight forward. For the price I’m happy."

I did a system factory reset too. So I just started checking all the Roku settings and found the power settings. Under settings/system/power, there is a power saving mode that shuts the Roku down every 20 minutes. I unchecked it and it resolved the issue. About the same time the power issue came up, the screen saver also turned off. I believe the firmware update for 10.5 reset these settings.

My Roku -- purchased February 2022 -- came pre-installed with YouTubeTV. There was a brief period in late 2021 where Roku went through a contract dispute with Google, and for those couple days YouTubeTV was unavailable on Roku. That's been resolved, at least for the moment, and now YouTubeTV is available. I tested it this morning and it worked. If you presently have a Roku without YouTubeTV but you want it, try adding the YouTubeTV channel via the Roku user interface.  Roku is way cheaper than a lot of the other streaming device options (like Apple TV) out there and it works really well.  When you log in, Roku will ask you to make a free account. There's a step in the account creation where they ask for credit card info, but you can skip that step if you don't want Roku holding on to one of your credit cards."

Vizio has also been glacial when it comes to adding new services when they become available. In this day and age, with new streaming services coming and going so fast, I didn't want to wait months or years for the Vizio people to get their act together. The Roku stick is beyond EASY. As long as you have a USB port on your TV and a WiFi signal, you're in business. Setup is so simple even my grandmother could figure it out. The picture quality is great although I'm looking at a 4K system and not OLED or 8K. Be sure and get the stick that comes with the re-chargeable remote that can power your TV on and off as well as control the volume. Some older versions only control the Roku and you have to use your TV remote to control power and volume. We've also found that it's a good idea to push the Roku ""home"" button before powering off. Otherwise, some streaming programs will automatically advance to the next program even while you're TV is powered off. This can burn through your internet data especially for series that may have several seasons. The Roku does have a setting to save bandwidth, but it doesn't always work for those type of programs. It's better at turning itself off if you just leave a menu for a service like HBO MAX or Disney+ up rather than an individual show or movie. Just my experience. Overall, it's a GREAT product."

I removed it from the packaging before wrapping it and set it up at my house using my streaming accounts (Netflix, Disney+, HBOMax, ESPN+, and Paramount). I didn't do Prime because I was concerned they haphazardly purchase stuff. They are in their 70's, so sometimes it's just easier to set stuff up, rather than try to talk them through it over the phone... When they opened it and installed it, all they had to do was tell the Roku their wi-fi password and it was ready to go! I even arranged the Apps that were available at the top of the menu and included a sheet of paper detailing which apps they could expect to work. Easy Peasy. They LOVE it!"
"Roku Express 4K+ 2021 | 流媒体播放器 HD/4K/HDR 带平滑无线流媒体和带电视控制的 Roku 语音遥控器,包括高级 HDMI® 电缆",Cleveland Area,387,77,"Got this Roku Express 4k+ and love the options it gives you for apps that your smart TV just don't allow. The remote can turn the TV on and off as well as change the volume. Voice Recognition can pull up a show on different streaming platforms. Interface is easily navigated and straight forward. Response is also very quick there isn't a lag when browsing and switching platforms. Like it so much I bought the Roku Ultra for the living room so this one will go into the bedroom. Also syncs with Alexa but the only thing that it will do is turn the tv off, pause and resume.  To get a 5G network to display when searching for networks you have to be on a high frequency channel on your 5G band. If by default most routers automatically select the best channel with least amount of interference. So you may see a 5G SSID one day then it will be gone the next. If you don't see the 5G network on Roku its broadcasting on a channel that is too low in Mhz so Roku won't recognize it. The higher the frequency the faster the data transmission is. You have to log into your router directly through the IP address of the router by typing for example 192.168.254.254 into your web browser while connected to the network. Enter the user name and password for router login usually username is ""admin"" and password will be underneath. You then have to find the option to manually select which channel band or frequency your 5G signal broadcasts itself. change that to somewhere near 5000Mhz or higher and boom Roku will show your 5G network!"

Set up straight out the box was extremely easy, I did it in less than 10 minutes. You can turn any screen into a smart TV!! I bought it for use with a projector and it works flawlessly. The remote reception is amazing, I don’t even have to point it at the box (even though they recommend you do). Best purchase I’ve made. So easy to connect and disconnect to other Tv’s or systems. Best purchase I’ve made recently hands down. Buy it!!"

My old roku's connect just fine excellent signal strength I plugged the Roku Express into the exact same TV and it gets no signal. Too many emails back and forth with their customer support which were worthless. Many many people report problems with Roku express. Don't bother buying this absolutely does not work well with Amazon prime streaming. When you fast forward we'll pause and reverse it buffers for at least 30 seconds sometimes a minute or more. My older Roku does not do that. All other apps work perfectly but not Amazon prime. Google this and you'll find many many people complaining about the same issue. I will be returning mine. Also, the Roku Express will not get more that ""poor signal"". I had to throw it out, I got my older Roku 2 out and it gets ""excellant signal"" consistently. The Roku Express line really SUCKS!!!!"

Honestly, it's getting harder and harder to justify paying for cable or satellite TV. We've already shown DirecTV the door. And if it weren't for our ""grandfathered in"" bundle package for internet, phone and basic TV with free HBO from Comcast, they would be history too. If you're concerned that a Roku might be tricky to set up or use, don't be. We got this 2nd one for my 85 year old mother-in-law who doesn't speak more than 3 words of English, and she gets along with it just fine, happily watching free programming and movies of her native land. It offers easy-to-use access to all sorts of streaming services, including YouTube Netflix, HBO Go, and a bunch you've likely never even heard of that ain't too shabby either. That voice command thing (a microphone button on the remote) seems to work well enough too. In short, for less than like a month's cable bill you might want to give a Roku a spin."

I have an older 47 inch LED TV and to me the picture quality of streaming with this borders on the fantastic and if the original sound broadcast is good so is what we get to my old ears. This is the Express 4k which is overkill at this point but if I get a new set the Roku won't be obsolescent. This is my second Roku and the old one still worked but this one has remote with voice feature, sound controls including mute and turns the TV on and off using Home and Power buttons. I think the picture looks better but that's subjective. I've used the voice feature and it works for me (another source of amazement). The response is quick...quicker than the older model. The only mild gripe I have is I keep inadvertently hitting the mute button and the supplied HDMI cable is a bit short. Price is very reasonable and the Roku folks give a really wide selection of what can be streamed. Set up is easy with some minor detours. Buy it and you won't be sorry."

The performance is great and is the primary factor in this review, but honestly it's also super nice having the voice input button, as well as the TV controls (power and volume) so we only need the single remote. The only reason I don't feel Voice Recognition is a 5/5 is because it doesn't work everywhere that you would need to use keyboard entry to perform a search, i.e. the in-app search interface."

I had to load YouTube on the device twice because it was too glitchy the first time and would lock up! The remote it’s easy to use however some genius decided to put the volume buttons on the side where you grab it constantly muting or changing the volume level! Dumb place to put them! With fire stick you just plug and play and YouTube app is already pre-installed! Roku, you have to go online and set up an account and guess what? They want your credit card information! I went back-and-forth on their website and then finally found a way around adding a credit card number! If it was a pain in the ass for me to figure it out, imagine there are going to be a lot of frustrated individuals that don’t want to put their personal credit card information on another website! I give it two stars because it works. After 3 days of resets, I packed it up and I’m going back to using the Fire Stick! Roku is a piece of junk!"

The most prevalent issue is random HDCP errors, but with this Roku Express 4K+ I also get random loss of the network connection. Doing a System Restart seems to fix both issues, but having this happen repeatedly does not make this a solution. Another device I use on my system that supports HDCP NEVER generates an HDCP error or disconnects from the network, so this is a definite Roku device problem. A permanent fix is needed."

Setup is not hard. JUst tie to your wifi router using the router password. But then you need to connect your streaming channel apps one at a time so your Roku can open them. Each app will hae its own password. Rouku's remotes have a tv on/off button, a volume control built into the remote, some have buttons for Netflix, Hulu etc. just like most smart tv's. Some can function by voice. But beware, Roku and YouTube TV have not agreed to have the YTTV app on their remote or home page, so you have to go through the regular YOuTube where you can click on YTTV. Hopefully that gets resolved soon and your Roiku can have a YTTV icon to to press on your home page."

I like that the remote worked immediately and did not require any extensive programming like some universal remotes do. It works flawlessly out of the box and controls the volume and powers the tv on and off no problem. It also works great on ""dumb"" tvs and is just as seamless to pair. So far I've bought 2 and I would definitely recommend Roku over Fire tv for the interface alone. I also like that you can download the Roku app and control your tv from your phone. All of my Roku devices show up on the app and it's easy to switch between the TV's."

I needed a small profile device for a 24"" tv (I'd been willing to purchase a replacement smart tv but all of the small ones had poor reviews when it came to speed). This roku is small profile. Slightly larger than the fire stick but smaller than the large square roku units. It was insanely easy to set up. It provides multiple options for adding your services, traditional log in and QR code. I had the device up and running with all of my subscription services logged in in under 20 minutes. The speed is fantastic. Legitimately as fast as any of the smart tvs in my house (Samsung and LG purchased in 2019). The voice remote works better than any voice remotes I've used before. It picks up your commands correctly every time. The only flaw is in the functioning after it picks up your voice but I think that has more to do with the streaming services. For example, I told it to go to Netflix and it did fast. Then I told it to play a specific movie. It pulled up the movie and the word ""Playing"" showed on the screen briefly, but the movie didn't play. I had to click the remote at that point to make it play. But really it's quick for locating a tv show or movie so I'm still happy with the voice commands. Overall, I am so impressed at the speed! And the price is so good. I just purchased two more units. It's going to save me a lot of money making use of older tvs instead of buying smart tvs to replace them."

The first few steps are shown in the pamphlet it comes with, then the moment I put the batteries in the remote (included), the remote instantly paired with our tv without me doing anything. Next steps were done via email. You do have to enter your card info. They want you to be able to easily buy stuff. Lots of streaming options come up for purchase. Our Samsung tv is about three years old for reference. I bought the roku so we could get sling tv bc I’m sick of Netflix and the obvious bias there, however, we find ourselves watching the roku channels the most. Free, unbiased news, animal shows my kids like. There are a few commercials, but no more then regular tv. Zero buffering. I wish we would have bought this years ago. Also, there is no activation fee, so whoever is posting that must have clicked on spam or something. Also, I was hesitant about a voice remote bc I don’t like devices “listening to us”, I know phones do it too, but it’s worth noting that there is a bottom you hold before using voice to search things. It saves time verses typing everything on a remote. Very happy with roku."

Streaming is fast, hasnt lost signal even once, and allows you to customize the look of the UI to suit your style. Love it but more importantly, my son does. 5 stars.

Sticks are great, but not always. You can't plug them in to most PC monitors because the USB is on the end of a long stick. With this Roku, you use any HDMI cord to plug it in. Works on ANY TV that has HDMI, not just ones that have inputs that work with a stick due to the size of it.  And, this is way faster than the Roku stick in my living room. I've compared three recent Rokus now, and this is the fastest, loading Hulu considerably faster, along with ESPN+, Disney+, etc. Every app loads faster and has a smoother experience.  If you catch it on sale, this one can be had for under $25 at times, so keep an eye out. It's still a good deal at $40 as well, considering the performance compared to the stick at a similar price."

As an aside, I hate this LG tv. My Samsung is older and so much less aggravating. They should stick to fridges. When it updates channels it logs you out of them most of the time, it still doesn't have HBO Max as a channel option after how long? It's really just a terrible interface. Updating the Roku unit has made a huge difference. I can basically ignore LG and get a great, crisp picture now for all the streaming channels I subscribe to, I won't have to sit there plunking on a remote every time LG logs me out of a channel (as a bonus, the voice remote works for passwords, too!), and I no longer have to juggle two different remotes.

So I wasn’t looking to replace, but thought I’d try Roku to be able to watch IMDb (Freevee), that can’t be ScreenMirrored, on our TV. Was inexpensive, so… Installing the receiver was simple and straightforward. Just plugged the power in and then the HDMI cable. Turned on the TV, switched to my HDMI input and was greeted by the Roku setup screen. Language setting, WiFi connect was super simple. Note: the navigation to enter Account info and passwords is much, much better than on the AppleTV. The setup moves you through a simple setup to connect to the TV and make the remote compatible (volume, off/on). You are asked to provide Credit Card info, but this is only used if you rent/buy a movie… using Roku is free. Then the Main Menu comes up. Comes with a couple preloaded Services/Channels like Prime and Netflix. I started with Prime which needed to connect to my account. I did this one old school… entering my email and password (again, easy navigation). Went on to Netflix but decided to use an alternative option. I was given a device code with instructions to go to my computer (I used my iPad) and go to Netflix.com/link. Once there I entered the code and the account was paired. Really, really easy for those provided. But it got even simpler. When to Search on the Main Menu to look for Freevee. Came up, selected it… boom it was added to my feeds and went through the same verification step. Did the same for The Great Courses which I’ve watched using ScreenMirroring. Easy to load and the Roku navigation for this service is nicer than from the iPad. It also frees up my iPad because it no longer is needed to stream. As an aside, my wife has had difficulty with the AppleTV user interface so I had to drive the remote. Roku’s user interface is so easy that I’ve lost my job as Streaming Service Navigator. The remote seems to be much more responsive too. Summary: Inexpensive - Easy Initial Setup - Easy to Add Serviced/Channels - Easy to Use and Responsive Remote  So impressed that I ordered a second one for the TV in the den. Came quickly. Easy installation and up and running."

I love the convenience of being able to move the roku from tv to tv if necessary and even bring it when traveling to plug into hotel tv's or airbnbs! I even plug it in to my projector for some cool movie nights! I love the ability to add apps and the roku has plenty of free channels for all kinds of different genres which is cool to switch it up sometimes. I wish some channels were a bit more reasonably priced but that's at the fault of the streaming services! It certainly can add up when you install multiple. I love the free youtube too for yoga vids or listening to music while cleaning. IMO, definitely better than roku TVs I've seen as far as sound quality, better picture, & the voice control features on the remote.

Interface is user friendly and easily connects to wifi. The only issue I has was with the Xfinity app which is very buggy and can only be used on your home network, but that is not Roku's fault it's Xfinity. So if you are expecting Xfinity to work outside your home network forget it. I would recommend downloading the channels if available instead. You may need a subscription like Xfinity to use a lot of channels. I also use it at home to replace Xfinity boxes which saves me about $8 a box then the Xfinity apps work good."

Remote is small and intuitive, Turns on and off my Samsung TV no numbers. Volume and mute buttons on side a bit awkward. Excellent range in both ends of the house. You may have to use an extender in a large house. Lots of free programs plus paid as well. Voice search leaves a little to be desired but is handy.

My TV, in its current state at the time, was limited to Hulu and Netflix. By connecting the Roku device to my TV my connection issues were resolved and I have access to all the newer streaming services including Paramount+, HBO Max, Hulu + live TV, Disney+, etc. There’s even access to numerous free movies and TV shows on a Roku channel and TUBI. For around $35 (no monthly charge for the device) my TV is like new and I saved a lot of money which I might have had to spend buying a new TV. Great product. I highly recommend it."

It was more expensive and as apps got bigger, it got slower. It was unusable, so I was hopeful that this more updated Roku would be better. It is like night and day. Responsiveness is great, no memory issues, I have had no issues. The one caveat that all should know is that Roku is getting rid of unofficial channels. No twitch or browser channels. You can find ways to do it, but they may get blocked at some point too. So only get this if you just care about the mainstream streaming services."

One previous reviewer said it does not include YouTube TV but that’s not true. Roku still supports YouTube so to find YouTube tv, look for YouTube tv on the left hand menu all the way on the bottom. Click on that and log onto your account. After that, it won’t ask for your account info again. I also like this 4K Roku because the remote has volume control, voice control and an on/off button, features which the cheaper Roku version doesn’t have. Great bargain for $40! If I have to mention one negative about Roku is that I’m having trouble figuring out how to change the input. I’ve googled how to do it, but I think mine is a different model. I use a DVD player and it’s convenient to be able to change the input on the remote. I have to just change it on the tv itself. Not a big deal, just inconvenient."

"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Mike T,1163,6,"I finally decided to buy one to help keep my TV relevant. Most of the apps from my 2011 model TV don't work anymore and was limited in functionality. I wish I bought one of these years ago though. Now, reading through previous comments, there is someone who gave 2 stars and complained about being single banded WiFi. This guy doesn't pay attention to what hes looking at. Yes, this is clearly stated that it only uses 2.4GHz band. No, they didn't go backwards in any form with this. With a quick search, and all Roku Expresses, which is what this is, have been single band. And 2.4GHz is fine when only going 1080p for HD.  Now about using it. Setting everything up doesn't take long, around 10-15 minutes. Once you have it set up, it's eay to use to get on Netflix, or Amazon Prime to watch your favorite shows. You can also download some other apps to get some free TV to you flip through another couple hundred channels and complain about there is nothing to watch, because we all know we do that. When watching something, the picture does take a minute to download, buffer, and catch up, so the first little bit may be a bit blurry, but it evens out. There is also the Roku app for your phone, and this adds some ease of use. Instead of using the remote to attempt to hit the sensor on the device, you can connect to the Roku on your phone as long as they are on the same WiFi network.  If you want to stream easier on your TV, or your TV doesn't have the Smart features you want, I would recommend this. If you want 4K video, then you need to look at something else because this doesn't off it. Also, if you really need to use 5GHz WiFi, then also, look elsewhere. Now, I can't compare this to other models, but this works well for what I wanted it for. Would recommend."

"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Dee Arr,19354,941,"I bought this Roku to expand into a fourth room, and I was happy to see that it was offered at a fraction of the cost of my other Roku models. Of course, this bare-boned unit asks for you to sacrifice some of the options on the more expensive units, such as a TV on/off button, volume control, and an earphone plug-in on the remote. All of these minor issues are easily solved by using both the Roku and the TV remotes or by employing the free Roku mobile app for iOS or Android.  A major issue for some consumers might be the 2.4 GHz wireless connection. After several days of use, we have seen no issues. Streaming has been perfect, no lagging or interruptions, and load time seems no longer than any of the other Roku units we own.  Installation was easy and there should be no hiccups for the majority of users. This was the first time that Roku asked me to sign up with a Google account, so it took the extra few minutes for me to set that up, but otherwise it was no harder than usual.  If you are looking for a solid unit and a great price, you can't do better than this unit. Five stars."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",DavyMac,882,28,"Overall, was I eventually moderately satisfied. The initial setup was a breeze. However, I got a rude shock when the video from a lot of channels wouldn't stream - instead of video, I got only sound and error code 020. (Of note, I was trying to run our Roku through an HDMI signal switch.)  As it turns out, a lot of HDMI signal switches/splitters sold on Amazon are NOT HDCP compatible. (HDCP is a form of digital copy protection; I only learned about this when trying to troubleshoot this Roku). A lot of channels available on the Roku use HDCP. So, as a result, content from those channels could not be streamed from the Roku to our TV through our HDMI switch/splitter. It took some Googling to figure this out - the Roku support article regarding HDCP error messages mostly discussed unplugging and replugging things, and turning things on and off again. It did not mention HDMI signal switch/splitter incompatibility. I would have been up and running more quickly, and ultimately more satisfied, if that had been the case.  After figuring this out, I plugged the Roku directly into the TV, and it worked perfectly. Unfortunately, I had to rearrange all of our other HDMI inputs in order to do this.  If you are reliant on HDMI switches/splitters, figure out if your switch is HDCP compatible before getting this incarnation of Roku.  Also, it is advertised that the Roku mobile app has a keyboard function - on my iOS, the the mobile remote control functions that I've tried work, with the exception of the mobile keyboard. Hopefully a Google search will yield a fix, but I would be even more satisfied if this keyboard feature worked right out of the box.  EDIT:  The remote control stopped working after a month. It's a good thing there is a mobile Roku app. Otherwise, we'd have to order a new remote."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",mike,1183,19,"I had to return it today though I only had it for 1 day or so. Reason: There's activation fee of $100, which was not specified on the webpage when I made the purchase. Based on the description on the webpage, I was under the impression that I just have to pay for the device & get all the free channels I want. It described that I only have to pay for the channels that were not free. However, when I finally got a chance to install the device on my TV & tried to activate it using the code on the TV screen, it told me that it failed. I called the support phone# & was told by someone with heavy accent who rudely rambled on & on about all kinds of benefits of activating the device WITHOUT giving me a chance to talk. After he was done advertising for his company's product, he finally said it would cost me $100 to create an account in order to activate it. He told me also before I hung up the phone that if I decide to pay to create an account, I'd have to call Monday (it was Saturday when I called). This might have been a good product, but the company should've made buyers aware upfront of the activation fee. In all, I was totally disappointed."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Rokair,533,434,Why have they gone backwards from a few years ago and are producing new devices (this is not the first so be careful) that support only the oldest 2.4 ghz wireless band. They talk about high speed streaming needing a strong wifi network and internet connection but limit you to the slowest option on your modern router. My Roku 2 second gen devices from 4 years ago do only support wireless N but they do so on both the 2.4 and 5.0 wireless bands. This makes a big speed difference on any network but if you happen to live in a populated area it makes a HUGE difference.

I just moved away from home and, admittedly, never had to worry about TV channels (I always just got on Netflix on my laptop anyways). But now that I’m on my own, I realized I now have a TV and A) had no idea how to stream to it and B) was getting tired of watching Netflix ALL the time but wasn’t ready to pay for cable. I know I’m extremely late in the game but I just didn’t realize just how many options are available to you with Roku!! (Maybe others as well? Not sure) so many free channels, but even if you want to pay for others it’s still so much cheaper than paying for cable alone  The actual device is tiny and so easy to use. Comes with all HDMI/other cords you need. Comes with a sticky piece to attach smaller pieces where the remote points to your TV. The remote you can download as an app on your phone is also super handy and you can browse channels very easily - screenshots included. Such a great investment."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",N. Nick,3464,521,"We needed to downsize our monthly cable bill so were returning the rented converter boxes and instead bought Roku Express. Set up was very easy, the Roku system is very affordable (they have several different models to fit your needs) and the Express was all we really needed. We continue to rent cable service and now have our Roku Express set up which was a very easy thing to do. Now we not only get cable service (through the streaming system) but we get a lot of other free channels/shows/movies/tv that we didn't get before. Another perk...no more ugly cables exposed as everything is plugged directly into the back of the tv. Great reception with a reduced monthly cable bill. We were so impressed that we now have all of our sets hooked up to Roku Express, even a smart tv that had no cable hookup located in our sunroom. This is a great way to hook up a smart tv on your patio as well...you will just need one outlet for electrical hookup and Roku will do the rest. Thanks Roku!"

"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Maryland Dad,167,67,"Initial impressions (which I will update after using the device for a few weeks) Yes, it was easy to hook into my TV. Yes, it seems to be easy to use and so far I am impressed with many of the features and content options BUT, they use dark patterns (evil tricks) to try to get you to input your credit card as part of the set-up process. Having a credit card is NOT needed for many of the features and content sites and they have obviously chosen to make it VERY frustrating for those users who would prefer not to give out their credit card information before choosing to make a first purchase. A simple ¨Skip this step for now¨ button is all that they need. But they chose to hide that feature and so they get a lousy review for having made their new device a pain to use during set-up. Shame on you, Roku! [Updated review]. After having owned this device for a while, I can say that it works great. Streaming via services like Disney+ works like a charm, and I continued to be impressed by the content on the Free Roku channel. If it was not for their sad attempts to trick you into putting your credit card into their registration system, I would give this 5 stars."

"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Ken F.,116,14,"Bought this to stream Amazon prime videos but unfortunately never used it because of the unreasonable (my opinion) set up data requirements. Connection to my TV and WiFi network was easy. The unit powered up and the ""set up"" menu appeared as expected. The menu directs you to login to the Roku web site with a second device to activate your unit. The Roku site requires you set up a Roku account to activate your unit.  This is where I ran into my issue with the device. To set up an account you MUST enter your name, your address, your gender, your date of birth and your credit card information. Gender, address and birthday info is irrelevant and none of their bloody business as far as I'm concerned. Credit card information is also irrelevant if I only use the free streaming videos.  So, unless you don't mind providing personal information to a unknown entity on the internet don't waste your money on this item. It make work very well, what little I saw worked fine, but blindly providing unnecessary personal information on the internet to any entity is foolish."

My Roku allows my to watch my British shows through 3 streaming channels I pay for and through multiple FREE channels only available through a Roku.

"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",mike couzens,154,72,"let me start by saying I love Roku devices I feel they are better than Amazon fire sticks and fire TVs and they are nowhere near as costly as the other options on the market from Apple. Unfortunately we've had nothing but Problems with the YouTube app not displaying full resolution, problems with HDMI connection not working and problems with Wi-Fi to remedy these issues a hard reset or restart was required every time. also I paid $27 to pre-order this product at a discount of $3 from its normal price of $30 then the device less than two weeks later is on sale for $24 and its predecessor is on sale for $22  So in summary this new Roku premiere is less capable has Wi-Fi issues, app issues, and HDMI connection issues and sells for more then the previous model which had none of these problems and was sold at a higher rate at pre-order price then it is currently being sold at the time of this review at $24, buy the older version Roku premiere at $22 to save yourself some headaches"

Yes, the higher priced ones are nicer, include things like headphone jacks, better wifi, etc. But for the price, this one performs above expectations, is easy to set up, and is a great value. The only thing really lacking is the ability to program the TV on/off and volume, I assume that feature was left off for price purposes."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Long-time Amazon customer,55,46,I read about the scam that asks for an activation fee. There is no activation fee. Roku does ask for credit card info to keep on file for things like rentals but I was able to “Skip this step” so you don’t have to enter that info either. Also thrilled that I can now get HBO MAX. I have an older tv and could not access HBO MAX. I can now through Roku.  Update: The option to skip the credit card info is not obvious. I selected the PayPal option and on the next screen there was a “Skip this step” link. So that is what I’d suggest doing. Possibly the skip is also on the screen where you enter credit card info but I did not try that.
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",JC Stewart,394,163,"Even the Roku Express will be an upgrade for your regular TV with an HDMI input or adapter! You can put 100s of apps on it like a good phone, stream perfectly with a decent internet service provider, drop your cable bill by getting rid of boxes or paying for a cheaper service with more channels if you don't mind the new learning curve of technology. The device is still not full of apps, all our Rokus have it all, and our family is a Roku family and we love our Rokus. With Frontier Gig service, the quality and color is perfect with no buffering at all. This device is hooked up by wireless, as well as I plan on getting a Chromecast Ultra to cast full 4K 60 FPS to any TV in the home with HDMI. I highly recommend hooking a streaming device that supports it to ethernet via ethernet switches to a newer router, you'll never regret your purchases... nor will you regret it with a wireless connection.

I really enjoy Roku for the flexibility it allows - I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to dump cable. You do need an internet connection, but that's it.

Almost didn’t buy, but in seeing those reviews debunked I did. So glad I went through with it. Extremely easy to set up. Got one for my camper as well. It asks for a card to have on account for future purchases but you can skip that without entering. I forgot I had set up a free account with Roku when I got our TV. It brought over my channels I like on the new setup. Get the free remote app. We love it. I will say we have this experience on a small somewhat older TV.

"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Holly K,51,29,"I bought one of these devices for the simple reason of wanting to view Netflix and Amazon Prime on my television rather than being limited to my phone and Ipad. I barely had it a few days before I was asking myself why I hadn't got one months, or years, earlier. I had no idea of the existence of 'free' television services (Stirr, Pluto TV and more) that were available on this device in addition to those I had subscribed to. It wasn't long after my first Roku purchase that I got 3 more Roku's for the other televisions in my home and ditched cable after 25+ years. Between 'renting' our four cable boxes, paying for service, and paying a 8.95 a month FCC fee, our cable service through Spectrum was costing us about $160.00 a month. We no longer get local channels but can pick up one of our local news station broadcasts through a Stirr channel. If you are not a big tv watcher at all or are the type who typically doesn't watch the newer shows on the big 3 channels (ABC, NBC, and CBS) then Roku in lieu of cable might be for you. On another note, I'm the type that doesn't care at all for the Alexis/Google/voice command equipment, so if you can relate Roku is the standard, push button device that doesn't listen to you, though you can buy additional equipment to make it happen if that's the route you prefer.

Lots of help videos on YouTube to help you tweak your setup, too!  My current TV is from 2014, and Amazon Prime Video loads a tad slow on it. Also, I can't get any of the newer apps for it, like Paramount+ or Disney+. So all I needed was this for ""a handful of apps""! And they all are faster here than they would have been if the apps were on my actual set.  My only regret was, there is no ethernet port on this model. Since I was new to Roku, I didn't think to check. I wired the house for ethernet, and want to use as little wifi as possible. But this is fast over wifi, and relatively stable. I've had a couple of occasions where it dropped out, but I re-started and kept going. When I want one for the older set downstairs, I will be sure to get an Ultra, just for the ethernet port. My old TV's aren't ready for 4K, ATMOS or need voice commands to tell it what to do, but there should be a less expensive option for ethernet capability. I'm just trying to make do behind the curve, I guess.  Also, look for a spare remote before your buttons wear out...I've only had mine a month, and the labels on mine are already starting to fade!"
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Alph,154,57,"Overall it's an awesome product that delivers a ton of HD streaming options, and I'm very happy with it. So let's skip past all the cool things that have already been said and go to one small flaw I've noticed: the remote control interface. To explain: I got the Roku Express to replace an older ROKU Stick from years ago. The main difference I've noticed between the newer Express model and the older Stick model: the Express unit can't just hang from/stick out of the back of my TV - it absolutely HAS to be positioned to face the front of the viewing area where you sit in order to receive input from the remote control, and the remote HAS to be aimed towards the Express when you use it (whereas the Stick could receive signals from the remote no matter where it was pointed...I could just leave the remote rested on an end table pointed it any odd direction - even backwards - and the Stick would faithfully accept remote input every time....not so with the Express). That being said, this isn't a deal breaker because it isn't all that difficult to find the right spot to face the Express towards the front...and while the Express remote still doesn't work from every angle, it's good enough. I also found a workaround solution for this issue by installing the Roku app on my smartphone - the app comes with a fully functional remote which for some reason DOES control the Express from any angle (just like the old Stick remote)...which begs the question, why didn't they just give the newer Express and remote the capability of interfacing at any angle like the older Stick model? But again, aside from this one small gripe, the Express is so awesome in every other way that it's still worthy of five stars."

When I saw how small it was I thought it might be slow - Nope! This little device is fast. It is really easy to setup and use. The only thing I did not like is that it requires a credit card to complete the setup. The streaming services we use are free with the exception of Amazon Prime and Netflix, both of whose payments are handled by membership with those services and not via this Roku device.  A really nice surprise was that the Roku Express let’s you easily connect your Apple iPhone and iPad to your TV via AirPlay. It makes it so nice to show your photos and home videos this way. It is also easier to watch YouTube that way. This is a fantastic device for the price."

This Time, during setup, after I entered the code displayed on the screen an ""error"" message displayed I was told NOT to request a new code but to call number shown to get new code and assistance with setting up ..... WELL big mistake!!! Do not get scammed like I did... I was told that after June 3, 2020 ROKU is requiring all Users to signup for an annual plan for $149 or the Lifetime Plan for $199.... Well after 2 hours of back and forth.. my main objective was to set up my new Roku... I fell for the Scam... paying the $199... immediately I received an Invoice and then was redirected to PayPal to pay the fee... I tried to pay with my Credit Card knowing I had some protection if I was dissatisfied.... Well, that didn't work, as they wanted you to pay with your Debit card.... Thankfully I was not successful getting the transaction to process with PayPal so the phony scammer processed the transaction with my credit card... After completing the transaction I did not have a good feeling about the whole experience so I then went to the ROKU website and right away I read that ""ROKU does not charge fees for setup or use of the device, if you have been charged fees YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED""!.... Long story I know but I immediately disputed the transaction on my credit card.. When I tried to contact the ""Customer Service"" number to cancel the ""Lifetime Membership"", which I was told I could at any time.... no answer.. or they blocked by cell number....

I decided to try this as an alternative to buying another computer. I was totally shocked at the difference in picture quality and over all dependency of Hulu over the ROKU network. I was, also, surprised to realize Roku provided a number of shows and movies free of any additional charges. Yes, there are movies and shows you can rent but these are totally free. I highly recommend this to any one considering this option."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",EFC,91,47,"I only received this player yesterday so I haven't had time to really learn all the ins and outs and how to navigate my way around all the content, which is very impressive. I don't know what I expected, but I never realized just how much content there would be. With the exception of your local channels and some regional sports channels, just about any channel or program and streaming service you might want to watch are here. If they aren't you can download the app for it. You also have the ability to watch free movies or rent them. First of all, everything you need to set up comes in the box. The player has a remote with batteries included, and an HDMI cable. You also have the option to either connect the power adapter or you can use the USB port on your TV if you have one. This eliminates more cords laying around. Set up is fast and easy. All you need is wireless internet and the player does all the work for you. It easily guides you through the set up process. It took maybe ten minutes to get through. The only complaint I have is the HDMI cable included is too short. I had to use a longer one I happened to have. It just isn't long enough to allow for the fact that different TVs have ports in different locations from one another. This is a minor problem, not really anything to keep you from buying this device. If you are sick of paying through the nose for cable or satellite and aren't concerned about missing your local channels and some sports channels then I highly recommend this player. You can play this along with your cable or satellite at the same time by just using the input button on your TV remote. If you want to have access to tons of content, this ROKU Express is a no-brainer. For the price you can't go wrong. I was somewhat suspect before I hooked it up but now I am very glad I made this decision. Buy one and start streaming."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Felson99,49,32,"I was upset that I had to upgrade from my older Roku 2 because it was no longer able to stream You tube. Every time I clicked on the You tube icon it would start to load and then bounce back to the Roku home screen. This is apparently a very common problem as there are allot of supposed fixes online for this problem. I tried all of the suggested fixes without any success. I did finally find that this problem is an issue with You tube and not Roku and decided to take a chance with the Roku Express. It did fix the issue I was having with You tube and it had other positives as well. Using it on You tube it responds much faster than my older Roku 2. It's also many times easier to fast forward and reverse videos on You tube which was always very problematic with the Roku 2. So if you are experiencing the You tube issue I describe, bite the bullet and get the Roku Express. Even though I was a bit upset about having to upgrade because of the You tube issue, the much better performance I feel now made it worth it. Going to hold onto the Roku 2 and see if possibly a fix might be found for this issue in the future and use it elsewhere in the house or possibly just give it to someone."

On your computer, when you sign up and get to the credit card screen, just click the ""Roku"" at the top of the webpage to go to the Roku homepage and you can skip it. You'll come across it again but this time there is a ""skip"" button.  So, you don't need a credit card, they just make it difficult for people to skip. What an amazing device eh? Hundreds and thousands of things to watch. Unfortunately for me, I can watch TV or use the Internet, I can't do both with 6Mbps (Mega Bit, not Mega Byte) connection or about 800KBps. You can go to the Roku Live TV channel and it works like a TV Guide for the newbies coming from Sat or Cable.  Anyway, I enjoyed it. Currently have DirecTV and this is far better. I just have to work on getting a faster connection."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Heather Froman,37,36,"Others have stated there is an activation fee. There isn't. You simply open the link they send you in the email. Make sure it's the right site and not some scam site that some seem to have come across by clicking the wrong link. It will ask for a credit card, most things do if there are things that may be rented or purchased. I didn't look to see if you had to do this or not because we use several streaming services so they would need it anyways. It does not charge you anything unless you buy something while using the roku. As to the issue of it only showing in a corner and not filling the screen. When you first set it up, it asks for screen resolution. 1080 was to big so I simply said pick another setting, it allowed me to pick 720 and it's fine. I think our tv is a 50 inch. I'm not sure of the issues that others encountered, except that they seem to be user end issues and not product issues. Roku can't be blamed for someone searching for a link and the user clicking on a scam website that was obviously set up to seem like the roku site. Just users need to beware and not fall for scams. Instead of searching type the link exactly as they tell you. Pay attention when you set it up so you pick the right settings. Don't be in a hurry to get to the home screen. I don't know about the internet issues some seem to have. Not everyone will have the same experience. If you want headphones and voice control well you have to pay the extra money for them. This works for streaming. Its not meant to control all of your electronics. It does what is stated. It streams the most popular streaming services and that's it. I'm happy with it."

I'm not saying it's perfect for everyone, as one reviewer who gave it 1 star angrily (albeit correctly) noted, it ""does not offer a native web browser to surf the internet...game over."" But another complaint I read that might be taken seriously (as it could actually be an issue in some instances) is that it only supports WiFi transmission up to 2.4 GHz. To be sure, if all things were equal, something like the Firestick (which also supports 5.0) might be the better choice, but since the Roku Express is currently $10 cheaper, and 2.4 is perfect for my needs, I'm personally happy with the Roku Express."

My bad! Also, I was sure this had a voice remote, but it did not, so this didn't have anything to offer that my daughter didn't already have.

"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",J,5,11,"I've used Roku, a Fire stick and Apple TV and Roku is the hands down the winner for their interface. It's extremely user friendly and right to the point where you simply build a home screen with only the apps you want to use. You don't have to scroll through a bunch of clutter like with Apple TV (which was by far the worst of the 3) and it's really simple to add new apps. They also have the Roku app you can use that will give you the ability to use your phone like a remote but more importantly also allow you to use your connected headphones so you can listen to everything without disturbing anyone else in the house. A very good feature if you have multiple TV's in close enough proximity or for night time viewing with out struggling to hear dialogue.  The only negative I've ever experienced with Roku has been the very few disputes they have had with the corporations that run certain apps which results in the apps not being available until the dispute is resolved. In that case its always hard to tell who is being greedy if not both. Other then that on a few occasions the stick will need to be rebooted to get working again, but that is hardly unique to this device and i can count on one hand the amount of times I had to do it in 3 years.  Pros  -Best user interface of the 3 major brands -Very simple to use and add apps. -App that gives you the ability to use your headphones for whatever you're streaming -Virtually all apps available -""It just works""  Cons  -Disputes that block apps from time to time (Usually resolved.) -Very infrequent reboots needed -Remote has predetermined app launch buttons that aren't customizable"
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",cteama,486,110,"I added ROKU EXPRESS after buying the ROKU ULTRA streaming media player. The smaller Express player is perfect for our master bedroom, where I don't watch as much and didn't feel l needed the somewhat bigger Ultra. Having said this, I think they give the same selection of channels to choose from - and the slightly lower maximum resolution is not an issue to begin with. I set the Express on top of the tall dresser that serves as our TV stand. It is barely visible, lying right underneath the TV. Reception via remote is fine from across the room. It works absolutely perfect and any problems that might arise with streaming actually come from our cable and Internet service provider and have nothing to do with the device itself. The TV picture is so much better than without this little box. I love the selection of channels and the ease of scrolling through everything I have put into my Home Page. The only improvement I can think of right now, is that I would prefer if the Express Roku remote also had a volume button. I like it both ROKUs so much, that I will definitely cancel our way too expensive cable subscription and rather pay for a few premium channels via ROKu instead. I wish I had bought these a long time ago."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Greenpoint,178,131,"Finally bit the bullet and decided to return 2 of my cable boxes ($20 monthly saving). I still kept the DVR. Easy to install and set up. All I had to do was download my cable company's app. I bought the bare bones model and it works perfectly, but I wound up buying an upgraded remote through Roku that includes power button for TV and volume control (so I only need one remote). Now that I can stream Prime, I am finally watching Mrs. Maisel after hearing so many great reviews. Also, I can stream my car's Sirius with the Roku and grove to my 60's music while doing housework. There are a lot more things to stream, but I'm a dinosaur and still learning. Highly recommend."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Jay Jaug,299,63,"Extremely easy to set up and excellent stream quality. I bought this in July, 2021 to augment my working-from-home activites. I've heard a lot of good things about Roku so I decided to see for myself (no pun) if it's really as good as advertised. Well, I was not disappointed. It's really easy to set up; dare I say 'plug-and-play'? I plugged it into my 2016 Samsung (not smart) TV and the five-year-difference in age between the devices wasn't a problem at all. I recently added another steaming service (Paramount+) on this and it was a breeze as well. This is a real good product to invest in. I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking to make their standard TV into a Smart TV (for less $$$)."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Garry,128,101,I bought this to put on a third TV. I bought a ROKU TV and liked it so much I purchased a ROKU for another TV I had. I liked them both so much I purchased this one for my third. I enjoy the free stations that have a lot of older programs on that I enjoy. It's easy to use. My streaming is very good as well. I am hoping ROKU stays in business. I will purchase ROKU TV's from now on if they are available. Most of their add on devices are very good. I would always want to purchase their later models they are always improving.
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Jane,84,63,"Really easy to set up. Just plug it in to the tv via hdmi, plug into and outlit and that's it. Once you set it up with your wifi, just connect it to the streaming services that you subscribe to. I think all the bad reviews are people who assume you get everything for free, which you do not. Roku is just the thing that lets you stream subscription services onto your tv if you don't have a smart tv/video game console that already does this. You need to pay for the subscriptions separately, like netflix, hulu etc. I bought this for my grandma to use the subscriptions I already pay for and just added her to my account for her to be able to always watch her shows even when they're not on cable. Very good purchase, would recommend anyone to just get one. Very simple to navigate."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Cather,88,37,"I bought my TV several years ago, and apps like Disney+ just don't load on it at all. Like, won't install because they want me to upgrade my TV.  Roku doesn't do that-- every app works on every Roku. The only you don't get with this is 4K, but I don't have a 4K TV. Also, the interface is much better. And I like being able to just use a web browser."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",H. Garcia,79,54,I bought this for the sole purpose of the guest mode. My mother has a private guest / AirBnB studio apt. on her property with all the trimmings. The guest feature is perfect for those travelers that are there for a few days.  The only issue I have is that it uses infra red to communicate with the remote. There must always be an unobstructed line between the remote control and the base for communication to take place. The Fire TV Stick wins out into his because it uses Bluetooth technology I believe. This is the one feature I don’t like. You simply can’t hide it behind the TV like you can with a Fire Stick.  User interface is easy to navigate. It’s much easier than the FIre TV stick to move around the screen. Stream quality is great as well. The price could be better. Wait for it to go on sale.
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Shelby,1,10,"I've used this pretty much every single day since I bought it! It's a great little device that can turn any TV into a smart TV, essentially. Setup was straight-forward and there weren't any activation fees. I also like that you can download the Roku app on your phone and use it as a remote too! Also, if your TV has a USB port, you can use it to power the device instead of trying to find a plug that's within reach of the rather short cord it comes with.  I wish this model had volume controls included on the remote. I know some later models have this feature, but this was the cheapest option I could afford and it gets a little tedious having to use a separate remote just to change volume. It also doesn't come with a power button like the later models do, but you can turn your TV off on the homescreen, so this doesn't bother me as much.  I also wish it had some other way of being mounted than the sticky strip it comes with, or at the very least have it include an extra sticky strip. I move my Roku around the house and the sticky strip doesn't work anymore. However, it adhered very well when I first applied it, which is why I wouldn't mind having extras or even having an option to buy replacement strips from Roku since theirs are pretty good quality! Or even if they could use velcro or something similar that doesn't wear out drastically over time.  If you're looking for a cost-effective way to upgrade your TV, I highly recommend getting this device! Over a year later and it's still functioning just as well as the first day I bought it. Definitely worth the money and then some!"

We were using a DVD player to stream Netflix and YouTube, but it was sooooo slow and drove us all nuts lol. We had contemplated buying a smart tv, but seriously the kid is 3? So we did so research and bought this. SO HAPPY WE DID. Everything he likes watching it right there on his tv. Saved us hundreds of dollars not only from not having to buy a new tv, but also not having to add a cable box to his room. Was very easy to install, very easy to use. Now he doesn’t watch videos on a tablet 3 inches from his face. He lays in bed and watches his tv. Great purchase and will be buying another soon for our guest room!!!"

Finalmente decidi por este pq tenemos un TV en la sala de estar q funciona perfecto pero es Antigua, no es smart TV, y no queremos cambiarlo. En fin... preocupada por los comentarios negativos compré este equipo y debo decir q superó mis expectations. La calidad de transmission es buenisima, la interface de usuario muy cómoda. No pague nada por activation ni por cuenta ni por nada, como dicen algunos comentarios, solo pague Roku, llegó a casa, lo conecté y segui los pasos q van indicando. Y listo. Muchas gracias Roku!!"
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",WiscoHunter,208,95,"Got this for an older set that I have in my shop. I avoided the fancy 4K units because I didn't know if this set would even support them. This is a no frills unit that requires line of sight directionality for the remote to work. The kit comes with a section of double stick tape so that you can locate the sending unit anywhere on the TV. I mounted this one on the top of the set and it works fine.  As I said, it's no frills. There's no volume control, power control, or voice recognition. That was not a problem for me because the one I replaced was set up the same way. Nothing new to learn, right?  Overall, this is a good choice if you have an older set and don't need all the bells and whistles."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",bjjoggs,3573,1875,"I purchased the Roku Express after hours of research on streaming products. I know streaming is old but it is new to me. This is the first time that I have purchased a streaming device.  First, I want to say the set up is quick and easy. I am not a computer geek however this took no time to complete. It included everything that I needed to set up. All I did was connect the cables and plugin.  Another thing is there is NO EXTRA CHARGE FOR Activation. The reason I say this is because quite a few people say that it is. Please read the instruction book and use the URL that will take you to Roku.com. It should not take you to a google page. If it does you are on the wrong page. If you use that site you will get a con artist. These people will say that you need to pay to activate. THIS IS NOT TRUE.  We are using the Roku in the bedroom. Soon as it was activated it was ready to use. I needed to purchase one for a second tv. The remote that comes with it does not have a volume button. That just means you have to use your regular remote. Or you can make your phone a remote. That set up is so easy.  There is plenty to stream for free or other streaming channels you have to purchase.  Another thing is, Roku activation does ask for a Credit Card. I do know a lot of people do not want to keep the Roku because of this. At first, I was apprehensive. But you put in a pin. This keeps that anything purchase I have to manually have to authorize it. That makes me feel safe. Any purchases on my credit card I will know right away on my telephone alert.  I am finally ready to cut the cable cord. I am tired of paying $200 a month. I am sure I will use Sling TV. Make sure you have a good internet speed.  Check how much your uploads are. Just know that Roku itself has a channel for free movies. This little express powerhouse comes with so many movies and hours of entertainment. I am going to buy a second one for sure. Do not hesitate to buy it. Easy setup and hours of entertainment."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",charlene,84,52,"I don't have a remote for my tv so I ordered a Roku so I could use its controller as the on/off/volume for my tv. But, this model of Roku did not have a power button on the remote, so you still need a controller to turn on your tv. My fault, I errored. They make too many models and people who are not familiar with them don't always recognize the differences."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",HHL,374,72,"We're a roku family. Always happy with the interface and streaming quality of the roku line of products. Easy to set up and navigate. Even my not so tech savvy mom set hers up straight from the box.  Love the search roku feature for specific movies/shows, makes it quick to find obscure movies without having to visit every channel. The app for your phone means you don't need a head phone equipped remote even for the more basic streaming devices.  As internet upgrades happen we find the devices need to be replaced every 4 years or so. Each one has been smaller than the last. Now they come with an hdmi cord which is super convenient. I do wish the mounting tape was stronger, none of them stick to the bottom of the television lile they should."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Marc J Chabot,66,67,"We had an older (8-10 years old) streaming DVD player that we used to stream Prime and Netflix using a projector on a large screen. It began to pause and shut down regularly, making us have to turn off the player and turn it on again, which would take about 2 minutes every time (multiple times during a 45 minute episode) and we thought maybe it was our internet service. However, my iPad had no problem streaming. My first thought was a more expensive streaming device, but we don't have a fancy 4k TV and don't care about 4k, so the more expensive versions seemed overkill. This was really inexpensive, easy to use and worked immediately. No more pausing and restarting and it does everything we want it to do and has more features than we care to use. We are happy and the pausing problems are behind us."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Richard F.,41,14,"Simple to set up and use. Kudos to Roku for the simplified remote, but could be a bit more intuitive. Could use a couple of extra dedicated buttons and maybe a volume control with mute option, but overall better than having one of those oversized, remotes with way too many buttons. The unit itself is simple to hook up and use. The user interface is a little annoying - could benefit from a better design, but it’s not bad...and certainly intuitive enough to start using right away. Streaming quality is very good, have zero issues with it. I actually tried to download the Roku app onto my TV but it wouldn’t install, that is why I bought this unit. It was inexpensive and worth the purchase. Offers plenty of additional steaming apps to choose from. Some are good and others are garbage (IMHO). If you are a cord-cutter or even if you are not, I would recommend this product. I know they have higher end versions with voice command capability on the remote but I didn’t need or want that. I don’t think anyone would be disappointed with this product."

Joining the Roku family is the best choice I ever made hands down plus there’s a plethora of movies, live shows, videos, sports, music, games, children stuff to adore, etc.!!! There’s so much entertainment one could be lost just exploring it all!! It’s a good lost though because there’s something for everyone to find and lots for free!!! I didn’t even know that the remote has voice control that’s another plus along with the good price! Choose what Roku streaming remote quickly because during my research for the best price the price went up after a couple days, but I was mad at myself for being to picky! I would definitely recommend to anyone, friends and family also of course!!"
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Wyatt Holtkamp,11,30,"What else can I say. I really think one should never buy a smart tv. These nice little devices do that for you, and get updates longer than the TV app will. plus, there is the added benefit of being able to control it from your phone and cast to it as if it was a chrome cast. (casting doesn't work perfectly, but it works.)  -My only gripe, and it's not even worth taking a star off for. Occasionally one of the apps will log out. But I don't know if that is the fault of the Roku or the app itself.  The 2.4ghz connection is not a problem at all. 1080p streaming works great. If you really want 4k, get the better model with the wired connection."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",daisyross,149,64,"Bought this to support Disney+ on our 2015 Samsung smart TV. It honestly didn't occur to me that it wouldn't work before we signed up for Disney+, so this was a much cheaper way to access it than buying a whole new TV. Overall, we all like the Roku and my 7 and 5yos can easily navigate the remote. The interface is clear and simple, and if you use multiple streaming services, they're all in there for you. If you're someone like me who reads all the private policy notices, be sure to allot a solid hour and a half for all that reading upon set up. One thing I haven't figured out yet is if there's a way to add things to the watchlist without actually having to click on it and go into it first. It would save time if you could do that just from the main menu. But overall, we like it. There were no sign up fees, I read other reviews stating there are."

This little gizmo makes watching TV so easy, and saves us almost $200 a month in cable bills. My husband's main concern was being able to watch the local news, but he can still do that with Roku. There's all kinds of national and world news too. We already had Netflix and Amazon Prime anyway, and with the Roku, we added CBS All Access. We lucked out because pretty much every show we watch is on CBS, and for $9.99/month we can watch any show we want, any time we want, commercial-free. There are so many channels and options! I just wish we'd done it sooner."

It is better and quicker than the older versions . . . A very good deal! Update . . . I feel like a dummy because I had a ROKU and the signal kept going out every 2 or 3 days so I bought a new ROKU believing it was the problem (Hey I am old school and am still learning tech stuff) the new one (this one) had the same problem so I investigated further and learned about ways to increase signal strength as I have a big 3 story home and my man cave is in my remodeled basement. Lo and behold the problem was NOT the ROKU! I love these things and highly recommend! Once I got a signal extender all was well! The low price is amazing and all that it does is unbelievable to one who grew up in the 3 channel rabbit ears TV era!! So you young people keep inventing stuff for us!!!
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Michael,1,15,"I HIGHLY recommend this for the non-technical person in your life. Installing the Roki onto my tv didn’t interfere with my existing wiring. YouTube videos were helpful in showing it’s features and interface. Once you buy this, you’ll enjoy hundreds of thousands of movies and tv shows. Find your favorite shows by title or category. Most is prerecorded, but there’s a hefty amount of live and local news by city (Like 9,000 cities are listed). If you have other pay services, Roki can communicate with them! It’s all free, but you can add what you want, when you want (No more paying for channels you’ll never watch (like Lifetime or The Fishing Channel lol). You’ll have to suffer through commercials in some cases and they don’t have a screen option that I saw, but (to me), it’s worth no cable bill. OVERALL, I’m pleased with the purchase. P.S. There’s sports too."

I had to find how to switch the inputs on my car screen but once I found it Roku takes you step by step - it adjusts the screen resolution automatically. Very easy! It comes with the HDMI cable and power supply that I connected to the back of my car entertainment system. Now I just wish I had bigger or more screens in my car! Great option for long road trips with my toddler. I do pay for unlimited WiFi in my car. Definitely worth it!

I read that a Roku device with version 9.3 software and higher is needed to access HBO Max. My old Roku is 9.1. I checked and that is the highest to which it will update. So, I bought this newer version and not only am I able to stream HBO Max, but all the channels are so much sharper. I almost ordered a different device other than another Roku after reading some of the reviews here. Apparently, some don't realize that you have to have an account that is associated with HBO Max to stream it. I definitely didn't want any device that listens to everything said. This one does not. You actually have to use the remote buttons. Oh, the horror. ;) The remote is super easy to use. This Roku sets up quickly and easily. It comes with an easy to follow quick start guide.

But, I also love Roku, for traveling even if you stay in a hotel or place where there is a smart tv, I bring my own, because my apps are preloaded with my accounts and recommendations and I have been traveling with family where they might not have a smart tv, so I have lent them my Roku streaming and they have been happy vacationers."

The setup is pretty easy and FREE, I have seen some reviews where people are saying they are being asked to pay. Any paid services can be bypassed when setting up.

We have Samsung smart TVs all through the house, but they don’t support Disney+, PBS kids, or CBS apps so we were always having to hook up the iPad for these things. Finally caved and I love the roku. I don’t have to wait for the tv to “warm up” anymore before accessing the apps and it’s so smooth and easy to navigate. Wish I hadn’t bothered with smart TVs and just jumped to this. Well worth $25.  Some cons though: There isn’t any volume control on this remote so you still have to use your regular tv remote. Also, the buttons on the remote are for specific apps which I guess is good if you have those, but wish they were customizable. Finally, the sticky thing to attach the little box to your tv doesn’t really work if it’s hanging underneath. It was fine when it was attached to the base and didn’t have gravity working against it."

Its not like a cable box, where everything is so sluggish. Scrolling through the menu almost feels like I am doing so on a well appointed computer.  Picture quality is A+. Im surprised how good it is on top of being fast. No hiccups, no interruptions as if I was streaming off my computer, and perhaps better in fact with certain applications. I havent tested them all. Mainly using Amazon prime video.  The one downside is that there doesnt seem to be a way to turn down the volume. But thats not very important.

The only fault I’ve seen so far is the cord on the Roku is 2 feet, short."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",DaveyBay,72,56,"Read that people were having problems getting it to work with dual band Wifi. Decided to try it anyway. At initial setup, you choose which band to link it to. it doesn't work on BOTH but it works well on one or the other. Setup was simple. Lots of channels. Had it for months and I'm happy with it. It is true that you have to enter a credit card number at setup in case you ever want to buy services or movies, but the same is true with cable. If you don't want to spend any money, don't order any services or pay-per-view."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Amazon Customer,283,286,"Haven't been to a theater since COVID and am developing an intense dislike for our cable company. This little box was easy for two of the world's least technological people to set up and it's paid for itself a thousand times over. We've discovered so much great stuff by having access to it. I only wish, as novices, that we could easily call Roku with questions as they come up, but this such a good thing I'm not going to deprive them of any stars for that!"
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",joel750,1078,290,This is one great TV streamer! Having this will save you $$$ from cable & Satellite bills which I know that no one wants to pay if thy could getaway with it. You buy this item ONLY ONE TIME....and as long as you have an internet connection through WiFi? This is all you need really and you're off to the races. Imagination watching your favorites shows with HUNDREDS OF FREE CHANNELS for the taking 24 hours a day.....With NO cable or Satellite dish bills to pay! A truly a marvelous machine if you ask me and a highly recommended item to have!
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Lynne D,137,170,"I haven’t used it yet, but I set up my new Roku Express today. I replaced my Roku 1 because I have a free one year subscription to Apple TV+. The set up was not as simple as I thought it would be but it wasn’t hard. You need a computer or smart phone to go online to your account to input a code that comes up on the screen during set up. I also needed a converter because my tv is very old. Once it’s set up it gives you a one minute video to introduce the remote and where to find things. So far I’ve only set up Netflix. The screen looks more like when I sign on through my iPad than it when I used my Roku 1. We will start streaming tonight."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Gloria Garcia,26,29,"Im so happy with this product. Wish I would gotten it alot sooner. Was a easy setup and allows me to put all my apps on it and add more within 5 minutes or less. I totally reccomend it if you dont have a smart TV. I initially thought i would have to get rid of my plasma TV but i really live the clarity and color and did some research and came across this Roku device and didnt wait...got it in a few days and boom, hooked it up and I'm so happy I dont have to watch only movies in the living room or off my phone. Super happy customer! Also it's very small so doesnt take that much space at all . literally fits in the Palm of your hand. Comes with the HDMI cord that goes from device to tv and power cord from the small device to outlet and remote. I give it 5 stars. Thanks Roku!"
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",MrsT09,15,26,"My favorite part of this is its size. Sits nicely on top of the TV outside, and gets great picture. Previous comments mentioned paying for use. It does make you set up an account if you don’t already have one and to put in payment for purchases of apps or shows that are not included. However most of the stuff is included for free. Set up for first time users can be a little time-consuming and clunky especially coming from an Apple TV."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",Meta Sienkiewicz,1,11,Device was easy to set up out of the box and did a good job detecting my TV. I had to plug it directly in the HDMI port on my TV to get it set up but it is now working great on an HDMI splitter. This replaces a more-than-10-year old Roku that was no longer getting updates; it is great to get some of the no-longer-supported apps back. Several of the apps offered activation via my computer so I didn't have to type in long passwords via the remote. I've also downloaded the Roku app to my Android but haven't tried anything yet. I'm looking forward to trying the Apple AirPlay for when I need to watch recorded presentations for work.
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",R. Chaffin,60,18,"Don't know how many people are like me. Finally had to replace my 1st generation Roku 2100X box that just kept chugging away until it stopped loading Amazon Prime. For $30.00 I figured I couldn't go wrong. First impression, I was right. Since I already had a Roku box attached to my TV, it was super easy to unplug the old one and plug in the new one. The ""box"" itself is super small. Luckily they include a double sided sticky strip that holds the device in place. Set up was also very easy. It automatically detected the Wi-Fi and then it walks you through all the steps on your TV screen. Adding channels also really easy. The interface is very different from the old version. But since I'm the last guy on the block to get to the party, this is obviously the new look. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles - just something that will do the job of streaming the channels I actually watch. So far, this is a winner."
"Roku Express | 高清流媒体播放器,带高速 HDMI 线缆和简单遥控器",They call me Mom,59,70,"I have been considering buying one of these things for the past couple of years but I couldn't really figure out how it would work. Now, I'm wishing I had ordered it sooner. It was super easy for my husband and I to set up. It's pretty much plug and play. There's lots of free channels that you don't need subscriptions for. It has made movie night so much easier. We love it!"
"TCL 32 英寸 3 系列 720p Roku 智能电视 - 32S335,2021 型号",Aaron Paris,328,78,"This tv was a very good investment. When I opened it up I was shocked at how big it actually is. It seems to be bigger than 32 inches. I’m disabled so I’m on a limited income so I don’t have cable or internet. I used my Wi-Fi hotspot on my phone to set it up. You need to set up a Roku account (which is free) it asks you for credit card information to pay for any channels like HBO or Showtime but I skipped that part because I don’t want to pay for more stuff. They also want you to download the Roku app, (which is also free) and it shows all the movies and tv shows you can watch for free. There is a ton of them. Then there is a section to set up any devices that you wish to hook up to your tv, like DVD player, game consoles and so on. Then you set up the tv part where it searches for the channels from cable or in my case, the antenna. It found 56 channels on my antenna. That’s more channels than I previously had. The setup was super easy, the tv is really lightweight, the picture and sound quality is exceptional and the size is perfect. I am very pleased with this purchase and I’m excited to use it. I just got it today so I haven’t really had time to explore everything yet. But so far I love it !!  UPDATE: I have had this tv for a long time now and I have had zero issues. I find it to be a good buy."
"TCL 32 英寸 3 系列 720p Roku 智能电视 - 32S335,2021 型号",Durt,1675,91,"This is one gigantic advert for ROKU - buy, buy, buy. They throw in the TV for free, basically. I just wanted a replacement 32"" for my office, and if returning it wasn't more trouble than it's worth - I'd send it back. I've never had to ""activate"" a TV. I guess if you don't have WiFi or email, you can't use this thing. Step one: register. Step two: there is no step two. You have to register. Whatever happened to plug & play? If you aren't paying attention - the first page of ""free"" activation asks you for a credit card. Huh? Just keep hitting ""continue"" unless you want to open up an avalanche of STUFF. Got a sound bar because all new TVs sound terrible - but still haven't figured out how the optical line out works, because you can't mess with those settings while watching a program. You get taken off line where you guess what settings you need, go back to the program, it doesn't work - rinse repeat. Wound up using the headphone jack out. I could go on and on. The remote is a joke. No volume control? But plenty of buttons for MORE PROGRAMS! Thank goodness my DirecTV remote was able to clone the beast. Want to just fire it up & watch satellite? Forget it - have to go to the ""home"" menu to access that HDMI port - right next to MORE STUFF. Look - I know I'm not the demographic for this appliance. I don't need 500,000 programs and movies. I watch the news, sports, an occasional movie. Period. I just wanted a cheap monitor (it's not particularly great at that either unless your eye line is straight into the screen) to plug in my DirecTV HDMI - and god knows I'm already getting soaked enough by those vampires. The bells & whistles were massively inconvenient and time wasting. If you're like me - old, grumpy & haven't watched a frame of a single mini series - spend a couple of extra bucks & get an LG or Samsung ""dumb"" TV that's a monitor first, and a content fire hose second. If all new TVs are like this - buy a used one. I'm about to get my old Panasonic plasma out of mothballs. God knows what Pandora's box of junk emails & spam I just opened."

The remote is a little lacking in buttons but I set up my phone as the remote and it has more options. It is a little lacking in quality picture if you use it as a monitor but it's still fairly good picture as a monitor too. I'm glad I chose this one. It arrived fairly quick and nothing was broken."

The picture is nice, the audio is nice. It was a very easy set up, even choosing which streaming apps I wanted was a breeze. The only con I’ve noticed so far is that the remote’s range kind of sucks unless you’re at a pretty much head on angle. It’s a nice smaller TV and such a steal at the price."

I have a 50 inch for the living room for the kids and a 32 inch for my bedroom for studying for school. I have been pleased with both. The tv is light weight, easy to set up, and the apps are easy to maneuver. I wish the remote had rubber buttons instead of plastic, but for the price i cant complain about something so trivial. I would buy many more of these if needed."

"TCL 32 英寸 3 系列 720p Roku 智能电视 - 32S335,2021 型号",KEAWV,155,146,This was the 2nd tv ordered. The first one arrived with a cracked screen. But it’s replacement arrived 2 days later and is working great in my guest room. Amazon is amazing! Two comments 1 the remote needs to be pointed to the center of the set. Guess I’d gotten use to just pointing in the general direction but this was a very reasonable priced tv and I am happy. 2. The tape they put around the edge stuck to the screen in a couple places and had to be fingernail picked off. But again very small issue. That’s why 5 stars. The picture and sound are very good. I just needed an inexpensive set for occasional use I was able to quickly attach the already installed wall mount. Very happy

Of course this happened a week after my return window closed, so I am basically screwed. The remote is extremely frustrating too. You have to push the buttons about 3 times before the TV even responds. Even tried changing the batteries. I'm pretty bummed with my purchase, and even more disappointed that Amazon doesn't give me any options to message them about my situation, since it is outside of the return window.  UPDATE: I was able to reach customer support through chat, and they made an exception to return my item and send a new one. I am pleased that they rectified the situation"

I can't imagine what advantages a set costing two or three times as much could have to warrant the cost.

I have two others of a larger size in different rooms, and I have had no problem with any of them. The picture, reception, and WiFi streaming are excellent.

Like anyone, I GOOGLE this to see where it may be hiding, only to discover this; as of DECEMBER 14th, 2020 “Despite our best efforts to reach an agreement, Roku has not accepted Spectrum’s offer to continue our contract, which allowed customers to access the Spectrum TV app from Roku devices.

So what is this little unit? Well, it's a fantastic ""movie night"" projector for a gathering of family and friends at an amazing price, but you'll need to make sure you have a very dark room (or it's very dark outside if you're having an outdoor viewing party) and you'll also need to not be a pixel snob, walking up to the screen and pointing out ""eww, I can see the pixels"". Yeah, you can see the pixels on ANYTHING if you get close enough.  Okay, so the description says 1080p right? Yeah, well that means it can PLAY 1080p content from a microSD card or USB drive, it does NOT mean that the internal LCD is 1920x1080 pixels in resolution. Does that mean that it's not worth the price? Absolutely it is. I dare you to try to find a projector with an ACTUAL 1080p LCD for less than $300 (at the very low end). What it means is that you'll need to chill out and accept that your little $65 projector is not going to be as sharp as the ones at the movie theater. Did you really think it would be??  I don't know about you but I always look forward to getting movies on bluray after I've seen them in the theater because even the theater ones (which costs TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars) are nowhere near as sharp as a bluray on a decent LED television, but you know what makes it cool? watching it on a HUGE screen! So if you pick this little thing up you can also grab a $20 projector screen here on Amazon and have your very own home cinema for well under a hundred bucks. This thing is easy to use, reliable, sharp (for the resolution it's capable of), and plenty bright enough in a dark room.  PROS: - cheap - long life LED bulb prevents having to purchase super expensive halogen bulbs - tiny and easy to carry - has a tripod 1/4"" thread on the bottom for easy mounting - has microSD, USB, VGA, HDMI, etc... - USB will power a Chromecast, so you can just plug into USB and HDMI and have a streaming home cinema - remote works well - goes from power on to ready in well under 10 seconds flat  CONS: - you won't be watching it in a bright room, the darker the better - 800x480 resolution (just don't be a pixel snob) - manual is in chinglish and very sparse (but use your brain and figure it out, it's easy)"

Furthermore, the following days I tested it to see some movies by connecting it to the PC, I put it even a little Under stress in conditions of not complete shadow and it still seems to maintain image quality, obviously when the lights are off / in the dark the quality is definitely higher and exhale the maximum potential. What can I say, I am really satisfied with the purchase, the projector also looks good in materials.

It far exceeded my expectations! The projector is very light (I attached it with the attacks of the Gopro to the chandelier of the room) and it is really easy to use. The remote control is also excellent. It has the ability to flip the view (if attacked upside down like mine) and to tilt it. The image quality is really good for the selling price and it comes close to a HD (considering that I'm looking at a white wall ... vote 10) As for the audio, it's certainly not a home theater but it does its own, I tried a movie and it makes it great, it can still be attached to any speaker. For the rest the HDMI also works with the Chromecast of which I attach the photos, with which you can very well transmit to the projector from a mobile phone (on the apps that support chromecast) or directly from the PC, through chrome, any web pages. The only flaw, the cooling fan is a bit noisy, but not very annoying, watching a movie the sound completely covers the noise."

It was a lot smaller thant I was expecting, and louder too, but the noise problem is easily fixed when you are watching somtthing. To answer some questions; you are going to need a lighting hdmi cord to broadcast from your iPhone, and hit ""trust"" when you're asked. The USB port is NOT for phones, it is merely for flash drives.

Even with my living room light on, I can still see the picture, although, I would recommend VERY minimal lighting. The speakers are ok.

Look at the pictures. They offer prizes for reviews and I believe that makes things worse for everyone.  If we can no longer trust the reviews from other shoppers, we will end up buying worse products than we thought. Even if they don't explicitly ask for positive reviews, we all know that's what will happen.

I did not want to invest a lot of money in it in the end I did not use it or whatever, and in the end I decided on this given the low price (to be a projector is super cheap).  I am VERY happy with it, I did not expect it to be so good, it is tiny but bully, the image looks like pearls, it can be adjusted as you want. It is very intuitive to use, I did not even use the instructions that came because it really is very easy to use. As for the noise it makes, I do not even notice it when I'm watching a movie or series. It has for HDMI (comes the cable), and also for VGA.

Works with mirroring your Iphone, Android, Live TV, Tablet, Laptop, Computer, PS4 , Xbox I don't know where to begin. I initially ordered only 1 for xmas( for a son that has all types of gadgets and this was something he did not own) but after playing around with it to make sure it worked, I had to get one for all of my 3boys and myself. Yes I bought 4 Projectors. They were on sale for xmas for about $55.00. Grab while it has 30% off. Great deal for this!! Yess Im truly pleased and excited about it. I haven't written a review on anything in awhile, years, but this was something I had to tell everyone about. I base a lot of my buying on reviews and YOU MUST BUY THIS. Ladies your man will love watching the game supersized on the wall. And the volume is loud. In the video my son is watching the game from his xbox. ESPN. It is much clearer than you see. He was laying down and I wanted to quickly record it.. He uses it for facebook, scrolling the web, watching movies, everything. ohhh, for xmas, I surprised everyone and had it on the wall, just the wall, no projector screen. We watched videos from last xmas as we opened gifts. It was the talk of Christmas. Since me and my family have used it on everything ( Iphone, Android, Live TV, Tablet, Laptop, Computer, PS4 , Xbox ) I wanted to share this important information for anyone looking to purchase. I hope this helps: With the Iphone you need to use hdmi adapter [Apple MFi Certified] Lightning to HDMI Adapter, for iPhone 1080P HDMI Digital AV Adapter Sync Screen Connector with Charging ( and yes I bought the $13.99 from amazon, works perfect. The real adapters are about $44.00 and I was not buying 4 of those. It has a remote. Android phones need a different adapter. Im going to do another review with my other son cause he has called me bragging about this since Christmas . I will update u with a future review if there are any issues that cant be resolved. Nooo Im not getting paid for this. Just excited to see the entire family fall in love with this.  March 2, 2021 Title: I am back with three amazing reviews, Not from me but each person I gave these projectors to as gifts. I have bought a total of 8 Auking Projectors. I asked everyone to write a review and send to me since it was ordered under my amazon account. . Here are the copied reviews.  My name is Tonya. I received this item as a Wedding Gift from my sister. I am happy to be doing a review on this. My sister had ordered 4 of these projectors for her family for Christmas. She called me showing me how it worked and I got so excited and wanted one. I got married in Jan and she surprised me and my husband with one and I was jumping and screaming because this projector is awesome. The video clarity is great, You can see it clearly in the day, but it is much better when the room is darker. My husband watched the live game on ESPN and he really enjoyed it with his brother. I hope they dont take it over now, lol. The picture size is really big, not sure of exact size. A video is attached. I love the fact that I view everything on my Android phone on the screen, while laying in bed. Below is her review she added in December.  My name is Theresa. I received this item as a Gift from Starr and I doing this review under her account. I never thought about getting a projector before I received it. When I received this item from Starr, she also sent me the link on Amazon so I would know all of the devices that it could be viewed with. My son (14yrs. old) actually plugged it up and showed me how it it works. It was really easy, nothing to read. You plug in two cords and attach to whatever device that you are using. My sons wanted to watch view things from his Iphone on the wall. I ordered an HDMI Connector cable from Amazon and it was also easy to attach. We have it in the living room because my teens enjoy getting on social media and playing games on the wall. We dont have a projector screen and we will get one soon. It shows up great on the wall. I will end up getting another projector for them because I dont want them using it so much. Everyone loves it is all I can say. Thank you for this great gift Starr, You are the best.  My name is Ana and I received this a Housewarming Gift from Starr. Me and my husband lovesss this Aurking Projector. We had been looking for a projector for a long time but we couldn't decide, which one to get. Thankfully we have received this as a gift. We have already had a movie night with family and everyone was talking about how they wanted one. The picture quality is good. It does show clearer at night but the quality is not bad during the daytime. I will be purchasing one for my daughter because she has been sneaking it to her room, lol."
"AuKing 迷你投影仪 2022 升级版便携式视频投影仪,55000 小时多媒体家庭影院电影投影仪,兼容全高清 1080P HDMI、VGA、USB、AV、笔记本电脑、智能手机",Sheila,165,23,"I purchased this projector with the main intention of using it as a digital art projector. There were plenty of reviews touting it's prowess as a solid movie projector, so I will stick to the other features and ways this little guy can benefit an artist. One of the main questions is ""can it project to smaller, managable canvas sizes?"". In the menu settings there is a button to reduce the image size, 100% to 75%. There are also options to adjust color, brightness, tint...you can take a color photo and reduce the color to 0 and work with the grayscale image! I had it working from a Samsung Galaxy 8, Note 20 Ultra, micro SD card and Windows 10 laptop. I was able to get a focused image as small as half a sheet of letter paper. When using a laptop, you can use a photo viewer or editor to manipulate the size, color, contrast as well. It had more than enough brightness in medium light, so you can see all of your tools while working with the image. It's bright enough to shine it through the back of the canvas as well, so one can work on the front surface without shadows from getting in the way of the beam. The canvases in the pictures are 8""x10"" and 16""x20"". Overall I'm super happy with this purchase and highly recommend it as a budget alternative to the pricey digital art projectors out on the market."

The picture quality is decent, and so is the brightness if your room is dark enough. I didn’t expect the best of the best like how we had at school, but I knew what I was getting into when I decided to buy a budget mini projector. I have no qualms about that, because I knew what I was getting myself into. It’s not a bad projector, by any means.

I have no qualms about that, because I knew what I was getting myself into. It’s not a bad projector, by any means. Now, I was about to get very upset at the fact that this projector didn’t work. there was no mention of how to use it with an iPhone in the booklet that came with it other than to use it with a lightning to HDMI adapter. When plugging the adapter into my phone and the HDMI cord into the projector, no matter what I did and no matter what setting I chose, the picture would not show up. I went through the reviews and saw people having similar issues. Before I rage quit, I decided to check out the reviews for the adapter that I purchased, to see maybe if there was some troubleshooting to be done there. Now, if you’re like me, you want a projector and you want to use it with your phone, but you don’t want to pay upwards of $300 for a big one and you definitely don’t want to pay the $42 price tag that comes with the Apple lightning adapter. I bought a reasonably priced adapter with good reviews hoping that I wouldn’t have any issues. I bought a reasonably priced adapter with good reviews hoping that I wouldn’t have any issues. But alas, it wasn’t working no matter how much i fiddled with it. One simple thing fixed this. take a look at the adapter that you were using in order to get a picture on the projector. Mine Has two ports.. One unidentified port with a symbol that I didn’t recognize, and one for the HDMI cord. If your adapter sounds similar to this (I will try to insert pics when i get back home) plug your iPhone charger into the other port and then plug the charger into the wall. This will charge your phone while also powering the adapter. Then, go to the input menu and select HDMI. As soon as I did this, the picture came on the screen after about 10 seconds. Hope this helped!"

So the instructions try to make you think that you HAVE to connect this projector to your phone however you don’t need to do that. We plugged our Firestick into the USB plug on the side, we changed the source setting to HDMI (but do it from the remote youre given DONT change the setting from the projector itself or it won’t work). And then we plugged in some $10 computer speakers from Walmart: Go to Settings from the Firestick remote and click on-Sound and then Surround Sound- and then pick the option that isn’t DOBY. And of course make sure your computer speakers are plugged into the Aux port on the side. Again this is only if you have a Firestick! I’m sure you can use a ROKU stick that plugs in or an Amazon stick you’ll just have to play around with the settings to get it to work for one of those. And then we just put up a little $4 shelf from Walmart and set everything above our bed. The pictures shown that is a 10ft wide wall and the projector is 15ft away. Crystal clear quality you just have to adjust the focus on the top.  We really have no negatives to this! Other than trying to figure out how we could make sure to get our Netflix and Hulu and such (which again we were able to do with the Firestick) that’s the only negative I’d say we had. Cause the original instructions immediately tell you the projector cannot stream Netflix Hulu Amazon prime but we hacked it! Definitely worth the money!"

Sound quality is pretty reasonable for such a small box. It also has a audio out, so you can use the projector as a pass through to your surround system/speakers. There isnt much you cannot connect to it. HDMI, USB, MicroSD, VGA, it all works. It is not native 1080p...it is 1080p compatible displayed on 800x600. Its plenty good enough for watching movies with the fam. The best thing about the projector is that its size makes it very portable, so its great for backyard pool parties. It has a tripod mount on the bottom so you can get it positioned exactly where you need it. If you're looking for a 4K DLP home theater projector, this isnt it....but it wasnt meant to be either. For what it was designed for, I give it 5 stars."

I did not want to invest a lot of money in it in the end I did not use it or whatever, and in the end I decided on this given the low price (to be a projector is super cheap).  I am VERY happy with it, I did not expect it to be so good, it is tiny but bully, the image looks like pearls, it can be adjusted as you want. It is very intuitive to use, I did not even use the instructions that came because it really is very easy to use. As for the noise it makes, I do not even notice it when I'm watching a movie or series. It has for HDMI (comes the cable), and also for VGA.

Just tested it today. Works fantastic. Exactly what I needed. I'm using it for the Jack O' Lantern Jamboree digital media. I also tested the ""Paranormal Passage"" videos and they looked great as well. I've loaded the media on a micro SD card. Once loaded, you have the option of selecting which ones you want to play. The projector will then loop through all the videos you have checked off. I'll likely order another projector to display a different video on the garage door. The small speaker is a little tinny as you can imagine but it has a headphone out which I run to a small portable Bluetooth speaker (but I used a mini-headphone cable to be clear). Remember folks, this is a $80 (on sale) projector. As long as your expectations are reasonable I think you'll be pleased."

It has a 1080p resolution. It supports VGA and HDMI input. Also, it comes with an HDMI cable which might cost you 10 bucks if you don't have one. There is a built-in system which has some basic functions like music and video player. You could use the remote controller to switch it between the projector and built-in system. What surprised me is that it has a speaker. You don't have to watch a dumb show if you play from a USB device.

The reviews had me nervous. I was blown away by the quality! The colors are bright and sharp. Picture quality is adjustable in a few ways and looks awesome. We don’t have anywhere in our bedroom for a television and even our walls have too many pieces of Art to mount a screen. We are using this on our ceiling above our bed. It was super easy to set up. I just plugged in the cord. Used the adapter (bought separately from Apple) to hook to my phone. The speaker is nice and loud and can be controlled using the remote control however it doesn’t have much bass so we opted to connect a Bluetooth speaker to my phone. I just can’t say enough about how thrilled I am with this product!

Packaged well, feels sturdy. I expected it to feel super cheap, due to its price, but it's great quality!  The setup was crazy-simple! It came with an HDMI cord, which I didn't expect! The remote needs 2 AAA batteries (not included), but the projector's control panel seems to have every button you'll need.  I plugged it in and turned in on. It was warmed up in seconds and standing by! Then I just had to change the source to HDMI and my Macbook mirrored my screen to it. At first the sound came through my computer, but that was a simple settings adjustment.  The picture and sound are great! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the fan seems loud. I don't have much to compare it to, so it might be better than other mini-projectors. Next week we'll have an outdoor movie night, so maybe I can increase the rating, since playing a movie outdoors might overcome a little fan noise.  It has a little foot in the front to angle the picture up, which is (or should be) standard on projectors. It also has a focus wheel that is simple to adjust, along with a keystone dial to easily correct the angling (skew up/down to make the image rectangular, not trapezoidal). It does not keystone left/right though, so place the projector directly perpendicular to your screen/wall."

Thank you so much for following up and standing by your product. I will definitely recommend it to all my friends!!  I had hight hopes for this projector, but I was very disappointed. First, it does not include the most important cabl, to connect it to your computer, so you have to buy it and it is $40 or more. you cannot connect it to your phone -at least not to an iPhone. once you get the expensive cable, the image is poor at best, everything flickers and it turns from natural colors to green colors -it is very irritating. I wish I had bought a cheap option, which would have work and with image that is the same or better. The sound is just a little better than poor, so be ready to connect it to a better sound source.

If you read any bad review of compatibility with the major streaming services (Netfix, Amazon, Hulu and Ect.) you are listening to people the have ""No"" idea what they are talking about. Most likely, these are the same people that think ""WIFI' and ""Bluetooth"" are the same thing, of which they are not. That's another review for another day.  You can watch ""ANY"" major streaming service as long as you do it directly and not using the mirror function. This means that connecting your device via a hdmi cable in the same manner that you would to your tv will work. It's that ""Simple"".  You can not stream from a paying service on your ""Android"" or ""Apple"" device and then send it to ""ANY"" projector. This is called ""Mirroring"" which is illegal and prohibited for ""Copyright"" reasons. Again, it's that ""Simple"" people."

Out of the box, I had to fiddle with the picture settings and focus but with any projector you'll need to do that to some degree, especially if you're using it in multiple places and distances like I am. I did a test run by hooking my laptop up to it via the HDMI cable and playing a youtube video I knew had a lot of black in it. Blacks could be better, and the balance of color/clarity for sure, but I was testing the quality on a cement basement wall painted a light-green which isn't ideal but I wanted to make sure it worked on arrival but also to get a gauge of the setup and playing quality. I also took the picture with my phone in ""night sight"" hence the additional ambient lighting. For the price point and my need to use this in different rooms, it fits my needs perfectly and I'm quite pleased with it overall. Next, I've got to shop for some screens and then take some updated pictures to see if that helps other!"

Purchased this for backyard entertainment instead of using my flat screen. Received it just yesterday 6/14/20. Have been trying to get it to work with any devices possible for the last 1 1/2 hours-have gotten nowhere. The instructions/manual are so vague and not helpful. Does NOT plug and play any devices listed as stated in the description. All devices connected receive ""NO SIGNAL"". Despite the description here on Amazon. The manual page 1 section 4.1 states ""USB PORT DOES NOT SUPPORT PHONE CONNECTION"". I tried every device in my home, desktop computer and laptop with the vga port, usb with my phone and tablet, the hdmi port with my smart tv, and the mico sd slot. None of these ports work.

Most of the negative things I had read about is true though. Set your expectations. It power on and goes through the inputs flawlessly. It filled up a 120"" projector screen with room to spare and was able to focus right in. No one complained about the picture quality. It was fine.  If you can: Use it in the dark or near dark situations Point the remote right at it when your using it Adjust the screen size by moving the projector Use alternate audio speakers (as I would with any projector or TV)  You'll be satisfied.  We use it to watch live concerts while we are camping. I can not speak for the durability but the nature we use this thing in, being around camp fires and outdoors - I'll be happy with it making it through 1 or camping seasons.

And I’m not disappointed. The projector is small, easy to operate and user friendly.  The remote is most useful for changing the volume on the internal speakers. We used it outside and although I will add an external speaker to amp up the “real movie” experience, it was plenty loud without that.  It does have a fan that you can hear a bit when it isn’t playing the movie but as soon as it started playing the film the sound just disappears, so not an issue at all.  It isn’t bright enough to overpower sunlight, but I didn’t expect it to be. As soon as it’s truly dark this little thing shines. Beautiful, bright, crisp image that it super easy to adjust to your taste.  The standard tripod screw mount on the bottom of the unit makes it super easy to put on a tripod and since it’s so lightweight it’s easy to keep it there.  I used it to stream Disney+ from my iPhone. Word to the wise here, you will need a lightning to HDMI connector and that was the only hiccup I encountered, not from the projector, but from the connector.  My first connector/cable was faulty so I wound up going and getting an Apple branded one and the problem was fixed.  Oh I also discovered that if my phone went to sleep while it was streaming it interrupted the film so I just turned that sleep feature off while it was being used and it was all good again.  I also tried streaming from my iPad Pro and that worded seamlessly too, once I turned the sleep feature off.  For the money I don’t think you can beat this little machine."

It works great; the image is clear, it's easy to use, has tons of different input methods. Navigating the menu is a little clunky without the remote, but the remote is easy. We don't use the sound on it, but it does have speakers and they seem to work well until we mute it.  The only con with this unit is to be expected in an entry price point item. The range of image adjustment isn't quite what I've seen in other more expensive units, but did not cause a problem for us at all with two different set ups.  We bought two, and both are exactly as expected. We also bought a stretch projection screen and plan to use these for outdoor movie nights, likely being run by a laptop.

Initially, I returned my product because I was not able to connect it to my Apple products. They reached out to me and offered to send me another projector via email. They also sent me a wifi HDMI because the HDMI I purchased did not work. However, the projector stopped working after the 2 times of using it. The project was super hot so I think it was overheated. However, the quality of this projector was very good and clear. Then they offered to send me another projector. The projector works very well but I just could not get achieve the same quality as the previous projector. However, they have such wonderful customer service! They reply to any of my questions or concerns within hours, less than 12 hours. I can really see the dedication and how much they want their customers to be happy and satisfied with their service and products. I highly recommend trying them out. 4/5 but the customer service really bumped to 5/5 stars.  Previous review, I posted my question regarding the iPhone issues and got no answers I purchased an HDMI cord for my iPhone/iPad and it didn't work However, it did connect to my dell laptop with a regular HDMI cord. Overall, I think it'd be a good choice if you need or care to connect with your iPhone. It works with my firestick TV too."

Very flimsy device, interface is very poor, brightness is awful even in a dark room (never mind outdoors). The deal breaker: whI put non-encrypted music (MP3) & video (MP4) files on a thumb drive in music and movie folders and the device file system didn't see them. The USB formatted in vanilla MS-DOS 32 format mounted on the device as C:\, and the folders were visible but not the files in them. There was couple of JPEG album art images in the music folder which could be seen and viewed but the MP3 &.4 didn't show nor play. Contacted the vendor and his response was put the files in music and movie folders and they will play. ALREADY WHAT I HAD DONE. I searched the web for a website but non could be found and I couldn't locate any software updates either. I returned the device promptly. Inexpensive as it were, any money on this kind of cheap junk makes it far too expensive.  Update: 05/08/2022 Vendor contacted me and offered to send ""an updated version"" at nor cost. I received a WeWatach v53 projecter which proved to new a more substantial projector. Its larger unit, much brighter, better sound, and doesn't have any of the problems that the other unit had. I tested in a bright environment and the picture is crisp and bright. Definitely a keeper. Highly recommended."

So, unless your smartphone or laptop has a hdmi slot (unlikely) you will not be able to use this projector out of the box. You will be stuck with going out and buying various cables (lightning to hdmi, usb to usb, etc.) before you can use it.

So we decided to go ahead and get one on Prime Day and this one was on sale. It turned out to be a great projector. It wasn't nearly as expensive as most of them and it has a great picture. Now, in the picture I posted, a) my camera took a crappy picture, and b) we had that thing blown up way bigger than it was intended.... However, when you have it to the right size and adjusted the way it should be, it has a great picture to it. Also my dog was freaking out thinking it was some sort of intense lazer pointer so she is in the way. We have used it several times since and have great times since the first. We need to get a screen for it because we just don't have great wall space for it and it would look better on a screen.  All-in-all, I think this projector is a great deal and worth the money."

Gives me the ability to ha e some lift if I want it. Overall it was a great buy and I could not talk about it enough.

Of course it cannot compete with the performance of a $300 professional projector. But for the cost, it works amazingly well. For its inaugural showing, we played The Boxcar Children. Our girls were thrilled by the 'theatre' experience, even though our 'screen' (a wrinkled sheet haphazardly hung on a bookcase) was far from optimal. We're excited to try it outside when the weather warms up. So far I've been using it with a PS4, which lets me use either streaming services or a disc from the local library. Besides movies, this is great for video games. I also can imagine it being very useful for presentations and slide shows. I hooked it up to a Chromebook and that worked flawlessly. I like that it has a place on the bottom to screw in a tripod, which we already have. The sound is good enough for my crowd; I like that there is a sound output connection so you could hook up self-powered speakers (e.g. 'computer speakers') if you wanted more expansive audio. I'm happy with this purchase and anticipate getting lots of use out of it."

I plugged it in, plugged in an Amazon Fire into the HDMI port, turned it on, and selected the HDMI from the source list. That was all I needed to do and it was ready to use. After that I played with all the remote buttons and menu settings to see what all it can do. It has good amount of adjustment for things like color, contrast, and brightness. Even though the living room wall I was pointing the projector at was dark, it was the middle of the afternoon and the room itself was quite bright. The picture looked washed out (because of all the light) but I could still watch it. I tried movies and sports and everything was clear and visible, just faded. The projector really shined when the sun went down. I left it set up and came back to it when the living room was very dark. I started it up again and adjusted the settings again to account for the new lighting of the room. Now it really looked good. It was much sharper and clearer.. It's never going to look as sharp and clear as an LED TV. It's technically a lower resolution picture that is able to reformat an HD picture. So, make sure you understand that you get what you paid for, If you accept that then you will enjoy many nights watching movies in the backyard, or gathering a big group of friends to watch a 100"" football game, and maybe even the occasional afternoon movie or ball game. It's very light and portable. It's easy to use and set up, and picture looks good enough - and big enough - for a large group of people to gather around and enjoy it!"

It comes well packaged and has a HDMI and Audio cable in the box along with the power cable and a remote. Setup is easy and takes 5 min max of which most is spend on locating batteries for the remote, those should come with the product. brightness is adequate for dark rooms. I use it outdoors with the lights off and it was very bright. The cooling intake on the back lets the bright light shine through which can be annoying if you sit behind the projector. The noise of the fan is noticeable but not loud. The speaker is loud but tinny and I recommend an external speaker. Some of my BT speakers have an audio port and the audio cable comes with the projector already. Overall very good for a budget projector.

What a fun way to spend a weekend with the family. We have used this twice now. Once outside and the other time indoors. Both times it worked great. We are so happy we finally made the decision to get this. I am certain we will get a lot of use out of this. Such a great way to break up the same routine and do something a little different.  Great quality for the size and seemed easy to set up. Hubby did that part so very easy for me. Lol.  Recommend this if you are on the fence about it. We have enjoyed it. Our neice has been back both times to watch a movie and we can't wait to have her sister back too. Her younger sister has cerebral palsy and she does not always enjoy car rides or crowds. We are hopeful that she will be able to enjoy a big screen experience without having to go far from home or have a big crowd.  Love it

We watched the how-to video. We watched several videos. We ordered new cords. We tried chatting with tech support. We called tech support. Tech support was going to call us back in 48 hours but our return window was closing, so we returned it. Auking refunded our purchase, and sent a new projector. We've been too busy to work through the Dell issues but it works great with our android phones and hp laptop. I have no doubt that tech support will do their best helping us when we have time. What amazing service and the projector is great."

I bought this for my husband for Christmas with plans to use it this summer and fall while camping. Well, quarantine made us think of more fun ideas. We set it up with our fence holding a sheet as our screen and it was super simple to operate. We didn’t think the sound was loud enough with our fire crackling in between us and the projector, but luckily, a handy set of old desktop speakers came to the rescue! My husband and our boys LOVED it. (My 14 yo even THANKED ME 😳) I’m beyond please and can’t wait for the rain to come in and go back out so we can do it again!"

Absolutely worth the price and your kids (and their friends) will think you are awesome. It’s easy to work and the picture quality is great for the price. We’ve just used a white sheet as a screen thus far and it has worked great. The built in speakers are loud enough that we haven’t had to plug in additional speakers. When you first plug it in the fan seems like it’s going to be a little loud but once the movie is going you do not hear it at all. We have played movies from Netflix, Disney +, and Amazon Prime with no issues. We just plug our phone in via an HDMI cord and play through their app on our phone. We have sound and video every time doing it that way."

After two years of living in a pandemic and not seeing my brothers there was hope that we could resume our tradition of going to the movies together. As different strains of COVID emerged I was uncomfortable with the idea of going to a movie theater. I started thinking of other ways to have the movie experience without going to the theater. My brother (the tech genius) suggested I get a projector.  As is my general route when I need most things I looked on Amazon and saw the Au King projector. It did not look bulky or heavy like the projectors of the past.  Once the projector arrived, set up was simple and took literally a few minutes.  My brothers and I watched the Matrix Resurrection (a snoozer) and I felt great having saved our movie night with one simple projector."
"AuKing 迷你投影仪 2022 升级版便携式视频投影仪,55000 小时多媒体家庭影院电影投影仪,兼容全高清 1080P HDMI、VGA、USB、AV、笔记本电脑、智能手机",Eli Kim,15,11,"First off, don't expect amazing 1080p on a 100"" screen. This is a low price projector for basic use. You aren't getting the best projector in the world for under $100. That said, this is a GREAT projector for the cost and actually worth getting for it's capabilities. I got it for a ceiling projector to watch TV/Play games before bed (10 ft from unit to ceiling). Other than having to swap out the HDMI cable before I lay down, it works perfectly for my needs and then some.  So I will start with the cons so you can tell what to expect. Cons ------ It does not project 1080p. It receives a signal for 1080p image and resizes it. Projector output is closer to 480p. It does not have wifi built in. The actual built in interface seems to have issues when testing. It will not respond with a USB flash drive plugged in (Power only?) and a memory card with some videos. USB port delivers power even when the unit is off. It is a bit loud with the fans on the unit if you are near the projector base  Pros ------ Unit powers on quick. Most projectors need to power up the bulbs and will power on after 10+ seconds. This unit will power on and be ready in 3-5 seconds. Unit works well with any USB/HDMI Device (roku, chromecast, firestick, etc) Amazing Brightness (in a dark room, this thing will light up an entire room at the medium settings.) Projecting 15 ft (4.5m) Makes a 100+"" image, and it actually looks really good. (That is how I noticed the resolution it was projecting wasn't 1080p). The speaker on the unit is actually able to produce audio considerably well. It worked well enough to drown out the loud fan at even a lower volume setting (15) There is an auto shutdown timer option, so you can fall asleep to your TV shows/movies and it will shut down at a certain time, or after a certain number of hours"

The quality isn’t amazing, there are moments when the pixels are obvious. BUT it’s good enough to forget about, so if you’re not too picky about the quality of the video then this is the Projector for you. The sound isn’t perfect, but using a speaker helps a lot. If you don’t already have an HDMI cord, then get one. You receive many wires with the projector but not the cord that you need for literally everything. Ultimately I’d rate this projector a 9.5/10 because it’s not too bad. It works, you can add subtitles if the volume is too low. Again, you get what you paid for so don’t have too high expectations."

It's like having a movie theater in my living room! The picture is crystal clear and I was able to connect my sound bar and fire stick without any trouble. The projection could be a tad brighter but it's actually nice to be able to watch a movie that is slightly dimmer than the tv screen - less stress on the eyes. It can run for several hours without a break. The fan is a little loud if you have it set up too close to you but if you have a speaker connected and can turn up the volume, you don't notice the sound of the fan much. I haven't used the remote it came with yet since I have my fire stick set up and only need that remote. I highly recommend this projector to folks who want an easy, affordable way to do movie night and still have it be amazing! Really happy with this purchase!"

The image is very sharp, just adjust the focus and the angle manually. Excellent brightness and resolution. If with light the result is sufficient, in the dark it obviously makes the best of it with very satisfactory performances. Even the audio is really good than expected.

Considering the price, the AuKing Mini Projector has a lot to offer. It's the best for its price. Don't expect it to perform like a $300+ projector, because that is not a fair judgment. It's great if you just need the basics.  Moving into a condo, I wanted to have a home theater instead of a TV/Cable. I was on a budget and didn't want to spend more than $100, and when I came across this one, it was a perfect fit. The picture quality, color, and brightness is great. The small size is exactly what I needed. There is a screw that you can mount onto the ceiling to a universal projector mount, or a tripod. The projector allows you to focus and move the angle to adjust. There are settings you can do such as change the viewing direction that I did when I mounted on ceiling.  The HDMI cable connects to laptops, DVDs players, and adapters for iPhones. Surprisingly the volume can go louder than I expected for the size. The downside is that the USB does not work however I just bought an adapter to HDMI and the mirroring from iPhone works. The key for best results is turning on when it is pitch dark."

Easy set up and amazing picture. If you can’t hear the sound (fire stick) go in the settings and switch the audio. Also it sounds great...if your sound is off...adjust it by hitting menu or the remote and going to the settings....I adjusted the balance to 50 (or less but not to low) in order to get what I feel is the perfect sound.

I connected it to my laptop using the HDMI and it worked perfectly. I ended up ordering a fire stick so I didn’t have to always use my laptop. Something to note is that fire stick audio isn’t compatible with the projector even though there’s a built in speaker but that wasn’t an inconvenience for me but the fire stick does have Bluetooth so I connected it to my speaker and ITS AMAZING. I would recommend getting a sound bar or something for that movie night feel. I’m super happy with this projector and can’t wait for spring and summer so that I can set up a screen in the backyard for movie nights. This is something I’d buy as a gift for someone it’s that good!

I do wish I could get a little more brightness out of it during the day when the curtains are closed, but as much as I love it, and even gave away a replacement I bought for it, it is SO LOUD. I found a video and took off the cap to try to clean out the lens with compressed air, in case it was weighed down with dust, but it still runs loud enough that we have to crank the sound up to drown it out. The most it runs is 6 hours at a stretch, before my PS4 goes into power save mode and the projector shuts itself off, too."

We put it in our master bedroom for bedtime enjoyment of Youtube videos. Overall, we're very pleased with the quality of this product! If we turn off the lights, our bedroom is instantly transformed into a home theater. To our pleasant surprise, the brightness doesn't hurt our eyes with all lights off. This is in contrast to some of the other projector brands. What's even more amazing is that if we turn on some ambient light, the projector video is still very much watchable. This is great for people who do not like to watch movies in complete darkness. Provided are some pictures that we share with everyone who is assessing which projector to purchase. Note that in the picture, we project the video directly onto our white wall. So, the video quality you see is without a project screen. Obviously, with a project screen, the quality would be even better! We haven't got the tiem to put on the projector screen yet, but the video quality is already pretty good, and we love it!  The built-in speaker is ok. It's not Dolby surround quality with ground-shaking bass but for Youtube or casual movie watching, it's more than sufficient. The speaker volume is definitely loud enough. In fact, we didn't even need to turn up to the maximum volume.  We purchased a wireless display adapter that is connected to the projector via its HDMI port. We find that in such a setup, you shouldn't use a cheap phone to connect to it, otherwise you'll suffer from pixelated videos. But I think this is because of the cheap phone, and not because of the projector. If I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (a relatively good phone), the video is great without any pixelation at all.  The projector comes with a remote control, but you need to purchase your own batteries.  AuKing customer support is great, by the way. They're very attentive and they always make sure their customers are satisfied. If you buy from them, you don't have to worry about non-existent customer support which seems so rampant these days especially from Amazon third parties.  I think that's about it for now. I will definitely share more as we explore this projector further, such as with a projector screen, etc. Overall, I'm very satisfied. I would definitely recommend this project!"

This is my first projector and after setting things up and a perfect Sunday night we were able to watch the game outdoors (sort of semi-normal feeling). The picture is clear, sound is good considering the size, menu, inputs and adjustments are self explanatory. We're looking forward to enjoy the drive-in feeling watching TV and or a movie outdoors.

It was bright enough for outdoors even with streetlights across the street. Using it indoors created a really fun movie theater feel. One con I found was that there are a lot of wires involved. I hooked it up to my DVD player with an HDMI cord and also connected it to a speaker using an aux cord since the speaker on the projector is pretty wimpy. I then had the projector, the DVD player and the speaker all plugged into an extension cord. It's not the easiest thing to travel with unless you have a checklist and space for all the cords you need, not to mention an extension cord and power strip. In order to connect to an iPhone you have to have a HDMI lightning cable. The USB port doesn't work with an iPhone charger cable which is understandable, it's just good to know before purchase. The picture quality was terrific, and the setup was straightforward when reading the directions. I am super happy with this purchase! It's a great little projector."

While this is straightforward simple little projector, I couldn't really be any happier. Only thing with this as with so many other projector is that you still need to be in dark room or very little dimly lit room (Brightness). But for the cost, this is great!

It took maybe three minutes to get everything rolling. Image quality 5/5: I have zero complaints. I used it with the blinds up in the day-basement (small windows, surprisingly bright), and was able to see and read off the screen. The focus on the lens was easy to adjust and spot on. Noise 4/5: a bit louder than I would hope, but not the loudest thing I've ever heard and absolutely tolerable. Overall: absolutely worth the price.  I did not try the remote. I did not try other cords (I only used the HDMI). I bought this primarily to trace sketches onto larger canvases for painting purposes and it meets that need fully. I would absolutely use this for movies as well."

This is not going to compare to a high dollar projector. It's not the brightest and sometimes there can be some blurriness around the edges, but for what I purchased this for was, backyard movie night setup, or a quick and easy projector to setup and watch movies with in the kids room. I must say this thing is impressive, works great with a firestick. There is what I believe ir in the front and back for the remote to work from both ends.

I should point out, there is a limit on how far this thing will project and still deliver clarity. The further the projector/bigger the picture the more you sacrifice quality. I had this up pretty high and far away from the wall I was projecting on, so for me it wasn't a great fit. It also works better in a darker environment.  Ultimately I ended up purchasing a different projector but the customer service with Auking was great and they were super responsive. I've worked in customer service in the past, and they truly did not disappoint. They even updating the directions and added a few steps on how to connect a device after my complaint with a few points that they left out.  All in all, I would definitely purchase a projector from them in the future if it was a bit more heavy duty.

We look forward to outdoor movies these nice summer evenings and I hope to use it while doing craft projects. This company went above and beyond what was necessary to make good on the original projector which was probably broken during the shipping process. They made sure I had a new functioning projector even after they had refunded the money and went this extra mile for me without me even asking for further compensation. I thought the refund was the end but here I am with a great, fully functioning, projector at no cost simply because this company cares about their customers experience with them!

Of course you need a darker room and such, but even with a little light coming in we had a decent picture. The photos here were taken outdoors at night, didn’t have a proper screen so we used a single white plastic tablecloth and were able to get this image.

The picture quality is good and it is bright enough to be visible at dusk (see picture). It does MUCH better in the dark. I need a screen instead of my ghetto white sheet but so far I am very pleased with the projector.  A few notes, if you are running off of an iPad, the sound will not work for HBO Go or Netflix via the HDMI cable. You will need to run the sound through another speaker. I use a Bose portable speaker with a male to male 3.5mm cable. I have an iPad air 2 so I still have the 3.5mm jack.  Also, the fan is a little loud.  Another issue that I didn't identify, likely my own error, is that the projector does not zoom. In order to increase or decrease the size of the image, you must move the projector. That isn't a major issue but can be a pain.  Finally, invest in a decent tripod stand. My lame table and uneven stone patio make it nearly impossible to get a level image. The projector only balances on one leg.  You get what you pay for with this projector but what you get is perfectly serviceable."

Noise level was perfect for what I used it for but definitely if you’re planning on taking somewhere kinda noisy utilize all the other reviews talking about hooking up speakers and such! I used as a cute boho date night he loved it. The picture was bigger than I expected. Super small and light.  Cons: remote is kinda finicky. As are most so it wasn’t a huge issue but still a little annoying when I tried to turn the volume up and had to wave it around like a mad women. Other than that…. My biggest and only REAL con is that when trying to adjust the height level there really wasn’t a whole bunch of option and wiggle room to do it so you either need to bring stuff to prop it on when you so take it out or just use it for like an in home theater so it isn’t moving. Really is a con based on what you plan to use it for.  Overall I’ve told all my ballin on a budget friends to buy this my bf loved it and I will definitely be using again. Still an awesome purchase!!

I ordered this one and my step mom ordered a different one for my dad on fathers day. We decided to test them both out to see which one we should return and I thought to myself that I got him the better one because this product that claims to be 1080P, but yet it has worse quality photo then the one my stepmom got him that claims to be a 780P... It's either this product over estimated it's quality or the other product underestimated there's. Either way, the one that claims to be 780P can display a partially bigger screen and get a way better pictures resolution/quality then this one that's supposedly 1080P... Very disappointed if I was really deceived into thinking that I was buying a well quality-built projector when in reality it's not... I've messed with it a lot trying to see if there was a setting I've missed, I found the optimal angle so that both the top and bottom of the picture were clean but it still showed a poor quality picture compared to the clearer 780P bigger size display. I'm fairly upset because there were many reviews on this product and it was just about at 5 stars rating, makes me think how many people thought they got a really good projector when in reality they were tricked and deceived just like I was..."

It arrived just in time for my granddaughters 4th birthday. Once I figured out how to use my fire stick with it along with a blue tooth speaker, we were all set to go!! Projector is small but good size and light in weight too. Picture is pretty clear and i was very satisfied with it. Great that it comes with a remote.

I liked the straight forward manual adjustment of the keystone setting, located right behind the focus knob. The internal audio speaker is quite loud if you want it to be. I use it with the HDMI input, projecting onto a neutral grey painted wall. I didn't notice any ghosting or aliasing in the picture. The remote uses regular AAA batteries, instead of harder to buy coin cells. My toddler really enjoys the cinema-experience that this projector provides."

It's extremely simple to use and quick to start up (about 10 seconds total). The picture is not 1080p (I found out that projectors that actually project in 1080p are labeled ""1080p native"") but I have no issues with the clarity -- after watching for about 2 minutes I don't even notice the slight graininess.  The projector has speakers built-in but I recommend connecting separate speakers for better sound quality.  If there's one small gripe I have it's that the keystone (controlling tilt of the image if you're not projecting level) creates unfocus-able areas of the picture at the top or bottom of the image, depending on which way you're tilting -- you can see the comparison at the bottom of the two images I've uploaded. I just keep the keystone completely level and it's a non-issue.  I've only used it about 7 times since purchasing so we'll see how it holds up!"

No, you can't watch it with the lights on, but in the dark, the picture looks fine. It's not going to be perfect HD quality, but for the price, I'd say it's just about perfect. Easy to use and set up and works great for a nice little movie date (quarantine style). You can see in the picture that the light shines pretty brightly out the back but I just put a little sticky note over it and it wasn't so bad. You can plug a speaker in with an AUX cord and using a Fire Stick on it basically turns it into a smart TV.  If you're looking for a cheap but good little projector, this one is a sure buy."

I was worried about the picture quality, but I am satisfied with both the picture and sound keeping in mind the low price. I caution that the image does not evenly focus. The image is bright and comes through albeit a bit dull on a cream-colored pianted wall during the day. At night, the brightness is very good and I was happy with the high-low contrast. The keystone is fairly limited. It runs quiet and not very hot. I cannot speak to the lifespan yet, only a few months in. A good projector for the price. I ended up buying another."

Incredibly easy to use, especially paired with a Firestick. Plug in the Firestick to the HDMI port then to electric. Plug in the projector. Done and done.  The speakers are loud and clear and very good; no need to add separate ones unless you're very picky. We're not.  The projector is lightweight and easy to transport.  The picture attached is of a wall in our kitchen in the middle of the day, right next to a french door. I included the cat for a size comparison. The quality of the image is excellent, and of course will be much better when shown on our screen rather than a wall and door.  So glad we made this purchase! Looking forward to movie night!"

It's anything but a 1080p goal. It upholds VGA and HDMI input. It also includes an HDMI cable, so that will come in handy if you don't have one. The built-in system has some fundamental capacities like music and video player. You could use the remote to switch it between the projector and built-in-system.

It's very easy to use with a laptop or phone. If you plan on using with phone, you'll just need a cable to fit your model. I have a galaxy s9, so ordered a USB c to HDMI. I had it projecting my phone within 10 minutes of unpacking. I'm not tech savvy, and can confirm its very easy to use and adjust focus. I have only projected to a wall and a white towel and was very impressed with the picture quality. A screen will only improve the experience. You will need a padded bag to keep the lense safe if you plan on transporting. I take mine camping and found that the cheap, padded , square lunch bags are perfect size. Before I bought this, I was watching movies (no TV set) on my phone. This is so much better! I can def recommend this projector for the price.

This did NOT disappoint! Less than $100. Compact size. Extremely easy to set up. We plugged in our firestick and speaker and wow! First we tried it in the bedroom. Amazed at the picture quality and brightness, even on a green wall! And the sound from the projector was surprisingly good! Later at night we took it to the hot tub and cast it on the tent wall. Again, simply amazed at the quality. Tent wall is navy blue and we still had great picture, it was just a little dark, but again, we cast it on a dark wall. It's loud in the hot tub so we connected our Bluetooth speaker (via aux cable) to the projector and had amazing sound! Set up was so so easy. This is not a high end projector. But for less than $100 it gives amazing picture quality! Very happy with this purchase!"

I can play movies off my iPhone and iPad and it’s just so great! I was mainly worried about the picture quality but I think this would work out even for a movie snob! you do need a separate connector for your iPhone or iPad so make sure you buy that separately mine was like $40 but considering that I just got an outside movie theater for about 100 bucks I am extremely happy! Oh The remote isn’t working but doesn’t really matter because you can work the projector without a remote. I find it better to use it without a remote anyway because I just lose the remote and there really is no point you don’t really need it.

Setup was very easy, but my 2018 macbook pro has only usb-c so I had to buy a separate wire. best way to use this is to connect your laptop to the projector with a cable and stream. Sound also is very nice, but if you want it to be louder you can connect external speakers for louder effects. The display and sound is also very adjustable so it is perfect! The size of the screen is also so large and amazing, and the remote also works well if you point it at the projector. Overall, best purchase yet for my new apartment!"

It's affordable and for what it cost, I expected the quality to be lower. Instead it surpassed expectations! Keep in mind that you'll need to fiddle around with the focus/distance to get things looking sharp. I've seen some other reviews complaining of picture quality and that's likely what's happening to them. If your picture looks fuzzy, make some adjustments until it looks just right. And yes, this is a budget projector. On bigger screens close up, pixels are noticeable even at 1080p. So if you're going to be bothered by something like that, I'd suggest looking at the high-end projectors.  One other nice thing about the projector is the sound. It has a surprisingly strong speaker. In fact, it's probably the strongest aspect of it. If you're watching indoors and don't mind sound coming from behind you, this speaker will more than get the job done.  My only issue so far is the remote. The range on it is not very good. You have to be standing right next to the projector to get it working and at that point, you might as well hit the buttons on the projector itself. I decided not to dock the score because thankfully it doesn't rely entirely on the remote like many modern day TVs do. There are buttons on the projector itself that you can use.  Overall, if you're looking for a budget projector that can give you an HD picture (With some tweaking!), I don't think you'll find better at this price."

I am perfectly fine with the sound that comes from the projector. The projector also has ports to connect audio extensions.  The image from the projector is were it lacks some aspects, do not try to play with lights on, you will not be able to see the image very much you need to have lights dimmed or off. I use the projector for sports programming, tv, and movies. Using the projector for sports games and tv gives a well image, but when you watch movies there tend to be a lot of dark images and that is where the projector fails. The dark images cannot be displayed well, I have tried changing the settings on the projector and it does not change much.  This was my first projector and am understanding the aspects of color and why some higher powered projectors cost more. I still believe this projector is a great buy especially if this is your first projector. I went looking through most of the projectors and selected this one because of the all ports and capabilities it has for connections. I connect the laptop to the projector and I am satisfied with the image and sound that comes from the projector.  The controller that is included with the projector comes in handy when you want to be away from the projector.

As a former sales person of stereo equipment we were always told to ""push new cables on new purchases"", and for good reason. I think the markup on cables and such might surpass jewelry!! It's just horrible. So stop buying those overpriced cables and buy them here on Amazon, or at a couple of other online retailers, for much, MUCH less. They work just as well as the name brand cables, just without the fancy colors, or the fancy labels. But hey, if you've got one of those unlimited budgets and money is no object, then go ahead and buy that $100+ per foot, 4 gauge speaker cable, or other severely overpriced interconnects."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Uncle Milton,2078,33,"I am going to keep this review short and sweet. I saw many reviews referencing these cables not being able to handle 4K HDR or support 4:4:4 chroma at 60Hz. While I cannot speak for the configurations of other users, I can confirm the following:  Using this cable on a Samsung KS8500, I can confirm that this cable supports:  UHD 4K HDR Content 4K 30Hz 4:4:4 4K 60Hz 4:4:4  I am attaching a picture of the chroma test as well. The bottom two lines are perfectly visible using this cable."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Matt,453,112,Amazing cables at an affordable price. Tested with 4K HDR and Dolby Vision. Works with Apple TV too. I have this HDMI cable going from my Denon AV receiver to my LG OLED TV and all my devices hooked to my AV receiver using this HDMI cable as well. Everything works great. Don't listen to the reviews that said Dolby Vision doesn't work on the Apple TV. They probably didn't set up their AV receiver and TV settings properly. The TV and the AV receiver has a setting that is listed as HDMI Deep Color or HDMI Enhanced that you will need to enable for HDR and Dolby Vision. Also it is prefered to set up the match settings under the video settings for the Apple TV.
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,MastaX,615,115," I went through 3 other HDMI cables before finally just deciding to buy this one, All other 3 cables I used previously were all from other highly rated brands here on Amazon, all them claimed to support HDMI 2.0 4K @60Hz. And you can guess those claims fell flat and they did not work whatsoever, Most of those other cables would have no image to the TV when selecting HDMI 2.0 mode and also there was horrendous screen tearing eve though v-sync was enabled in the games I was playing on my PC.  Well I am happy to report this is the very first cable I got that finally works as advertised. It can fully transmit a 4K 60Hz image over a 25 foot cable with no signal loss whatsoever. It even fully supports chroma 4:4:4 like a charm. This cable is an absolute beast and I cant believe how cheap it is. The other cables I got that didnt work were all over $60 and this $12 Amazon cable beats it in every way, I am a true believer in the Amazon basics brand for life now.  This cable is also twice as thick as any of the other HDMI cables I have and that just goes to show the great build quality, Its not a downside in any way, I just put the cable up on the wall across some nails and held up no problem.  bottom line if your looking for a great quality HDMI cable to stream games from your PC to your TV then get this cable! I am a very technical person when it comes to this stuff, this cable has it all, Full support for every chroma color mode and full fledged 4K @60Hz. Ive noticed across the internet about people complaining of weird screen tearing when using HDMI cables to their TV's from their PC's and I was also having this issue with all of the other cables too. This Amazon cable does not have this issue. Gaming from my PC to my TV is finally a fully enjoyable experience.  Final rating: 10/10 would buy again, no questions asked!!!"
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Oliver,9044,174,"Please do not waste your hard earned money on overpriced HDMI cables in the name of picture or sound improvements. I currently am using these AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cables to connect our Yamaha v379 AV receiver to other HDMI enabled devices that link back to our 4K Samsung Smart TV and these have performed flawlessly.  HDMI cables come in four types: Standard-speed --> Standard-speed with Ethernet --> High-speed --> High-speed with Ethernet. Since High-speed cables are so cheap (e.g these AmazonBasics cables), there really isn't any point of getting Standard-speed anymore. On the other hand, as most HDMI devices today can't receive Ethernet over HDMI, High-speed HDMI cables are really all you need.  ** Some numbers **  Standard-speed HDMI cables are rated up to 1080i (""i"" stands for interlaced). In order for a HDMI cable to have a ""High-speed"" moniker, it must be capable of showing resolutions up to 4K --> 3840 x 2160 at 30fps (or 4,096 x 2160 at 24fps). And as the highest resolution any 4K TV currently on the market can produce is 3840 x 2160 at 30fps, even if you found a $100 cable at your local BestBuy that claims it can transmit much more than that, it doesn't matter as you are limited by your source (i.e your cable box, Xbox, PS4 e.t.c) and your TV's hardware capabilities.  Also HDMI cables can either produce an image/sound or nothing at all. There is NO in between. Therefore, a HDMI cable will either work or won't work (it may show a flashing image but this means it's a bad cable). But a more expensive HDMI cable will NOT show darker blacks and sharper colors than a less expensive HDMI cable. You either get 100% of the signal or no signal at all. Now if you intend on running your HDMI cable for more than 50ft, then you might want to invest in a HDMI cable that has ""active"" chips that help maintain the signal quality over a longer distance (but does NOT make the image/sound any better than the source).  ** What about HDMI 1.4 or 2.0 or HDCP 2.2? **  This is another common misconception due to manufacturer marketing. HDMI 1.4, 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 are all hardware changes that do NOT require a cable change! Although there is a difference between them (you can google that yourself), there is no such thing as a HDMI 1.4 or 2.0 or HDCP 2.2 cable! The version numbers refer to the devices that the HDMI cable connects into & NOT the cable itself. The cable simply is a pipeline linking the two. Hence, if you do happen to own a TV and another device that both have HDMI 2.0 ports, any AmazonBasics High-speed rated cable will work perfectly fine with it.  ** Conclusion **  At this price point, there is very little reason to spend more money on more expensive HDMI cables over these AmazonBasics High-speed cables. If you have a 3D, 4K, HDCP 2.2 or HDMI-ARC compatible device, these High-speed cables will work perfectly fine for you."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,AK,312,51,We had bought a new TiVo and a new TV and for the lif of ours we could not pinpoint which one was malfunctioning when the sound would dip during different times of viewing.

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Kindle Customer,522,90,"I just bought a very nice Sony 4k television from Best Buy in Alpharetta, Ga. I bought a stand, 4k DVD player, Marantz amplifier and two HMDI 2.2 cables from the Magnolia side of the store. When i looked at my receipt later, I was amazed to see that I had paid $130 for an 8 foot HMDI cable and $100 for a 6 footer- plus 7.5% tax. The cables had silver wire in them and were supposed to deliver great sound. I have excellent hearing, and the sound quality of these inexpensive cables is almost the same. Most people would never know the difference. Satisfied? You Betcha! I returned the expensive cables and walked out with the $246 I had paid Best Buy. 3 of these cost about $12."

Great cable though, no issues whatsoever ever! The only concern I really have is that the cable cord is thick, a lot thicker than your standard HDMI cable. So for planning purposes this is important to note. I mounted my TV on my wall and used to cord/cable covers to maintain the wires. I was barely able to fit the TV power cable and the HDMI cord in the cover but I got it eventually. The cable works great just understand 25 ft is A LOT of cable and the cable runs a little thicker than your typical HDMI."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,phillygirl,499,291,"Purchased these to use with the apple lightening adaptor to connect the hubby' iPad to the tv. He wanted the capability to watch Amazon, Netflix and other videos on his not smart tv and this cord and the adaptor worked perfectly. Videos loaded immediately -much quicker than through the wifi connected blue ray player. All we had to do was connect everything, turn o. The tv and select the source and we were up and running. We connected the iPad to the smart tv in the living room and enjoyed watching a movie on the larger screen. Can't beat the price for the twin pack. I have the 2nd one plugged into the living room tv so we can quickly connect the iPad. The 10' cable ended up being a little too short to be permanently attached to the bedroom tv - the cord was out in the open for the cat to play with. I remedied that by ordering the 15' cable which I received today. Hooked it up and it is out of the way! I highly recommend these cables. They work perfectly and you can't beat the price."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,David Nadas,178,180,"Bottom Line, These cables do not support HDCP so you will NOT get the dialogue track, only the sound track associated with the video stream, making for some very interesting streaming of movies... LOL.  I recently ordered, installed new HDMI cables to support 4K in my home theater system. The thing about 4K is that all the devices and cables from content provider to display must be 4K compatible or the digital content drops to the least common denominator in the path.  My wife and I thought we were watching a very avant-garde episode of FOREVER (Amazon Prime) through our Roku, where we could hear the music soundtrack but the character's dialogue was silent (like a silent film). We thought the producers wanted us to figure out we needed to watch this episode with sub-titles and CC to get the true expression of the characters and feeling of the episode and to watch it as someone who was hearing unsound would watch it. I have to say, it was quite a pleasant and awesome experience not to mention the episode fit right into watching it this way. But when we watched a different series, the same technical flaw occurred, which led me to look at the cabling. I had to swap out this new cable from my Roku to receiver to get back the dialogue. These cables do not support HDCP."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,T,255,132,"I had my new 4k tv's installed recently, and I needed new wires capable of handling the speed and data being transferred for the best picture possible. I've read about the over-priced cable wiring, and I am guilty of purchasing those wires in the past. I have paid up to 600 dollars for an HDMI cable in the past, but it was for a true theater. However, if you aren't running very large distances, 50 or 100 feet or more, then these cables are more than sufficient to give you the highest quality picture you will get out of the tv you purchased. Most of the over-priced cables do nothing for short distance connections, since a quality cable with the required standards will give you the best possible picture, since the quality of the tv and the other equipment is the more important factor. I wouldn't trust some of the HDMI cables that come with the equipment or from the cable company, but the minor price increase you will pay for the Amazon cables is definitely worth the price and more than sufficient."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Phil in Magnolia,26828,1603,"This Amazon HDMI cable is one of the many very reasonably priced 'AmazonBasics' products available here on this website.  HDMI cables (and really any cables, in general) have long been subject to the claims made by some sellers that their (much more expensive) cables were higher quality, faster, and so forth. In fact, any HDMI cable that satisfies requirements for high speed 4K video will work just as well as any other.  I did some independent research before purchasing these cables (I purchased the 3-pack, 6 ft length, which is a great value):  - CNET's article ""Which HDMI cable should I buy?' dated November 21, 2017 (you can find it online at CNET dot com) explains what matters and what doesn't, and states that you can't rely on labels to tell you what a cable is capable of - ""The only way to verify it works is to test it."" It think that it is somewhat ironic that the article goes on to list recommendations for cables, but they are based on 'reputable companies that have great user reviews and have sold HDMI cables for years' and 'rated to have the bandwidth to handle 4K and HDR content'. - wirecutter online article ""Cheap, Great HDMI Cables"" dated February 1, 2018 (available at thewirecutter dot com online) - same author as the CNET article cited above, but published slightly more recently (still does not have any test data, though) ---> CNET's and wirecutter's recommendation: this AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable  Various other articles I found online make the same clear statement - that price doesn't matter - but I didn't find any comparison tests that included this Amazon cable.  This AmazonBasics cable specifications are the final confirmation to me: ""meets the latest HDMI standards (4K Video at 60 Hz, 2160p, 48 bit/px color depth); supports bandwidth up to 18Gbps"". These specs are as good as any cable currently available. And finally, this cable has a lifetime warranty. How can you beat that?  As a final point, I purchased the 6 ft length cables simply to be sure I had long enough cables for wherever I happen to place my equipment. Several of the articles I read point out that any cable of 25 ft or less should have no degradation of video or audio quality. This AmazonBasics cable is available in lengths up to 35 ft, with the longest version including something called 'RedMere' technology. I'm not familiar with that particular term and it appears that it is only sold by the Amazon Warehouse Deals outlet, so it may be a discontinued model.  I have one of these cables now installed between my Apple TV 4K and my Sony HD television so far. Video and Audio quality are excellent."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Phil,593,215,"Ordered a 25' cable to connect a PC with an NVIDIA GTX 780 to a TCL 65"" 4K TV. Works great, but the plastic shield at the connector is a little on the wide side, so it *almost* didn't fit snugly into my graphics card because the metal slot is just slightly more narrow than the width of the connector. The cable itself is also incredibly thick, even thicker than standard coaxial, which I was not expecting. Not a huge deal because it makes me feel like it's much more durable than competitor's cables and it isn't too stiff so cable management is still a breeze, but the standard sized cable clips I got to run this along the baseboard were much too small so now I have to measure the diameter and get something a bit more specialized to make everything look nice and neat. No complaints on video or sound quality. Functions as expected. Great price. Would buy again."

The picture was always out of sync with the sound. It would frequently freeze up. I had to use a wireless Bluetooth speaker for the sound because the sound would not come from the TV. Lots of annoyances. I assumed it was a WiFi issue. WRONG! It was an antiquated technology issue! I was using an old USB-to-VGA cable. My computer is pretty new, and I recently realized both it and the TV had HDMI ports. So, I thought I would try a new HDMI-to-HDMI cable. I was in the middle of watching a YouTube documentary from the computer using the TV as a monitor with jerky, sound/action syncing problems when I got a notice the cable was delivered. I stopped, got the package off the porch, attached the new cable and was blown away!!! It was like watching a high-def TV broadcast show! It was never my WiFi, it was always my antiquated technology! AND, now I could also use my Bose speakers that are connected to the TV! Can't wait to watch live-stream church services now! HDMI-to-HDMI is definitely the way to go, and this cable works great!"

I received the amazon cable on dec 8th, having amazon prime helps. lesson learned order amazon whenever possible. After receiving the rosewill hdmi on the 14th i compared the 2 cables side by side for quality and size. The amazon hdmi cable was 3x the size of the rosewill cable, and quality seemed much higher in cable construction. The amazon cable looks identical to one of my expensive over priced monster hdmi cables. If you are looking for a good quality cable I would highly recommend the amazon basics hdmi cables. The price of the rosewill cable was 10.99 for 25' and amazon was 12.00 for 25' well worth the extra dollar.  I have a lot of electronics hooked through my receiver 4k tv which is hooked up on the 25' amazon cable and everything works perfect. A fyi, 25' is the limit for most receivers, I would do hdmi over cat 5, 6, or 7 if any further away."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Carollee,205,105,"****2020/10/28 update*** I bought another one to run the cable from my living room to bedroom. It works perfectly as the last one did. I've been thinking about checking out the fiber optic HDMI cables. Gonna do some research.... But this cable is great!!! Highly recommend it!  *****older review***** This is an awesome HDMI cable. I got it to connect my 50"" Toshiba fire tv to my PC (Pic 3) I was afraid that the length (15') would diminish the quality of the video, but nope! It looks awesome. Extremely clear HD quality with movies and especially my gaming. The graphics look insane! I have an Invidia GeForce gtx 750 Ti 2gb video card and it does its job. The cable itself is pretty damn thick! (Pic 2) I put the penny there to show you how thick it is. I like it. It seems like it'll last a pretty long time. Of course it'll be stationary, It won't be moved at all. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this cable. I wouldn't waste money on those pricey cables claiming high speed and HD. All HDMI cables are made the same. Now if you get the 25 foot or more then I think you would require a booster because of the length. But this 15 foot cable has no problems displaying HD quality picture. Would definitely buy again."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Mr. B,154,113,"When I had this cable stretched to it's 25 foot length in use it performed as described with no issues. 4K HDR @ 60 was achieved with zero issues. I rearranged my setup and cut the distance to roughly 1/2. Since the cable proved it's worth I simple made large loops in the cable to take up the slack and not put excessive bend strain onto the cable. I started to get graphical glitches, cut out, and full signal lose for seconds at a time randomly.  Due to the quality external construction, this is a THICK cable, I wonder if even with large loops placed in the cable it create signal interference that messed with the signal. I usually buy cable longer than I need for changes in room furniture but due to the affordable prices and quality of the Amazon Basic cables I'd recommend trying to have multiple lengths that are the right length for your applications."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Timothy,150,59,"If you need one, this is the one to get. I specifically purchased the 25' length and am happy (only a week, but anything changes, I'll let you know). The cable is very thick, and is running from a ground level Blu Ray player to a TV I hung from the ceiling. It works for my purpose, and it will probably work for yours too!  I purchased a few Looong HDMI cables, one from here, but they NEVER worked. There was another brand ( Ultra Clarity Cables ) that promised 4K and all with the 25' length. it could only work at low 480p resolutions, all monitors/TV's would blank out with an unrecognizable signal; the cable was BRAND NEW!!?? I'm glad that Amazon took the garbage back without hesitation. I just don't want other's to waste their time looking for a cable as long as I did (factoring the purchase, shipping and returns, that's $100's in man hours wasted)... so save some time, get this AmazonBasics branded one, and be happy!"
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,David P.,720,283,"This review is for Amazon Basics High-Speed HDMI Cable (18 Gbps, 4K/60Hz) - 25 Feet, Black. Product arrived promptly, well-packaged in a sturdy box and with plastic protectors for connectors. This is my second purchase of this product (first was in April 2020) and I am fully satisfied with the performance. The cable appears to be of high-quality and durable material. My first application was to connect a security camera hub, located in the attic, to a TV about 20' away. This second cable is used for a video output from my laptop's usual location to a TV input several feet distant. Video and audio quality across the HDMI cable are both fine for my use."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Amazon Customer,3,20,"This is a very reasonably priced 25 foot HDMI cable. What makes it even better is that with the right equipment it can carry a 4K signal. Although, I am not in a position where I currently need 4K picture quality on any of my devices, it is nice to know that these cables are capable of carrying such a signal since I am fairly confident that 4K display is the picture quality that more and more devices will support as technology continues to evolve and I suspect that my needs with that will eventually change as a result. The cables purchased here were very cost efficient: in fact, I picked up two for less than the price of one from a major retailer.  My major complaints about this item stems from the fact is that they are rather bulky and heavy. This has caused me to have trouble orienting them so that I can plug them into the HDMI ports on some my devices. I have also had experience with them knocking over some of my lighter weight electronics since they are so bulky and inflexible. Having plenty of slack in the cable to work with solves the latter problem somewhat."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,The_Lotus_Pod,61,30,"I've known over the years to just find an HDMI cable and use it. Price doesn't really matter since HDMI has a standard, and all HDMI cables have to adhere to that standard. The only major issue with price is the material quality, which still shouldn't matter, as it's a cable that gets plugged in and sits, mostly without movement unless you're doing a specific thing with the cable.  I had been using an Apple TV 4k for some time and after I bought my first 4k TV, I noticed the video quality wasn't the greatest, and I know 4k was supposed to look incredible. The straw that broke the camels back was when I took one of the HDMI cables I owned and plugged my new PC into my 4k TV to play some Bioshock Remastered. Noticed the game only ran at 30 FPS and 4k didn't look so great. I figured this was due to my old cable being HDMI 2.0, and decided to go shopping for new HDMI cables.  This Amazon Basic cables are incredible. They get the job done, they're high quality materials and they're long. They also come in a 2 pack FOR ONLY $10. You have to be joking if you think this ISN'T a good deal. I'm so glad I purchased these, and I'm thinking about buying 1 or 2 more packs of 2 just to have around the house, or even to switch all the HDMI cables in my house because I'm pretty sure all of my HDMI cables are 2.0, which doesn't push video to my 4k TV like it should.  If you're looking for HDMI cables, you can not go wrong with these. Remember, HDMI has a standard, if you're spending $50 on a Monster HDMI Cable, you're wasting your money."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,randumtasx,872,520,"Bought this as an amazon warehouse deal (generally a pretty good buy) and have not been disappointed. The cable is built sturdy but not too thick that moving it around objects becomes cumbersome. I use it to stream my Mac to my TV in order watch live streaming games etc. What i'll say is that the mac allows the user to optimize the ouput for tv or computer, and when put on the tv setting the picture is as clear if not better than the computer. I purchased the 15 foot cable and some have indicated that at lengths over 10 feet there is distortion etc, though i have experienced none of this and there is no perceivable delay in sound or picture or quality from the cable. To note however, i'm also running it from a lightening port in the computer, through a converter to HDMI which, one would think would increase the delay and decrease the quality, though as mentioned, no issue as of yet.  Five stars and highly recommended as with all amazon products"
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Uncle Phil,3099,64,"Roku's been around for many years making great products so I won't go too deeply into its functionality (it's awesome!) but I do want to share why I bought it and how i use it primarily.  I've only owned chromecasts in the past but as part of my job, I travel very often and stay at hotels for the majority of the week. If you're not aware, hotels often require you to log into the wi-fi network typically with your name and room number and chromecasts do not support these types of logins (since it doesn't have a controllable UI - even on it's companion apps!!) so odds are you won't be able to connect chromecasts to the network.  Great thing about Rokus is that there is a Hotel & Dorm feature which allows for this exact sort of situation and can accommodate most wi-fi login procedures. It's an absolute breeze and I've never had a network issue with this unit.  Also, I love that it comes with a HDMI cable."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Orweller Family,255,274,"In order to provide an excellent signal at max length with 4k... they went all out with the cable size and shielding. It's large, bulky, and a bit impractical to use to flop onto a laptop because it doesn't bend easily. If using this for a permanent installation this is a good choice and is HQ. I wanted this for the laptop to the TV from across the room for video conferencing, and it's a bit clunky for that. I don't fault them for HQ, but just a heads up if you are looking for a setup/teardown video conference with a laptop - you might want something less thick and rigid."

Upon moving into our new home and hooking up our TVs, we realized we had only one HDMI cable left for the living room TV.  We have a PlayStation, a Roku Premiere, and a ""dumb"" TV, so we had to constantly move the only one HDMI cable between two different consoles, which was inconvenient and bad for the ports. Cables can get expensive, so I looked on Amazon, and found these AmazonBasics ones.  When we received the cables, hubby asked about which version they were, I checked the box, there was no label saying which version it was, but the box did indicate that the cables were made in February of 2019. If you are like me that don't know anything about cables, these cables will most likely be plenty sufficient for your general use. I did not even know there were different versions...  The cables arrived in a nice box, and they are long enough, and of heavier gauge compare to the cable that came with my PS4. We plugged in the cable, and it worked perfectly. We are super happy with the price and the quality of these cables, highly recommend!"

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,MyL,89,34,"Like a Kirkland Signature product, Amazon delivers a great product of equal value to others for cheaper. I've used all three I've bought for my PS3, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV. All of which are used frequently, and I've had no video or audio issues the last 4 months outputing 1080p at 60Hz. Never go cheap on HDMI chords. Especially the really cheap bundles you see around here. They will burn out faster, have connection issues, and the casing around the port will, 9/10, bend or break easily. But definitely don't go for really expensive ones that advertise stuff like 'Gold connector allows for Super 4K HD Video/Audio' output, and 'state of the art wiring design that reduces noise compared to the competition' because all of that is marketing bs to make you pay more for the same capabilities in a more stylish package. Speaking of bend, the wire on these does not articulate well so it may make routing the cable in tight spaces difficult compared to a nylon cable."

We bought long to snake it through, but it never made it in the wall. We ran a test from cable box to TB, and the reception was awful. Swapped out to a different shorter cable, and it worked fine, so I was able to isolate it to the new cable. Eventually we solved the problem with a wireless cable connection. I never really had issues with Amazon basics at all in the past, we purchase and use a lot of cables with phones and such, so I'm chalking this one up to a one-off problem, but i basically smoked the money for this one."

My new monitor has HDMI and VGA ports, and I ordered this cable ONLY because it didn't cost significantly more than a VGA-to-HDMI cable or adapter would have. Besides, how MUCH of a difference would it really make? Well, here's my answer: WOW!!! I've read that HDMI enhances the audio as well as video signal, but this is like going from tuna fish to caviar! My monitor's HD resolution now resembles what I'm used to seeing only in electronics departments and sports bars. But it's what I'm hearing that's really blowing me away: the warm, natural, vinyl analog sound I grew up with has been reborn, and my twenty-dollar computer speakers now sound like I paid five times as much!

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Montuno,3,4,"I upgraded an Apple TV 2nd Gen with a refurbished 4K model. Initially I did not replace the HDMI cable since it was working fine with the old Apple TV. When using the Apple TV 4K the image was spotty/pixelated, the connection was lost every few seconds and an HDCP error would be displayed every now and then. I initially thought the refurbished Apple TV 4K was faulty but decided to search Google and try a few recommended fixes. A number of articles advertised using certified HDMI cables to guarantee the quality of sound and picture. The prices for these certified HDMI cables were too expensive for me so I decided to buy the AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable. The HDCP errors and all the other problems mentioned above went away and I can view 4K and HDR videos using the Apple TV. The HDMI cable has been in use for 6 months now and there are no issues. The description for this cable does not include HDMI 2.0, 4K 60Hz, etc. I read a few articles online and agree with the Amazon review by Oliver, this is just marketing. The Amazon High Speed HDMI cable is as good as the other certified and more expensive cables. In the rare occasion that you get a cable that is faulty or doesn't work properly (it happens), send it back to Amazon for a replacement, those expensive cables are not worth the money."

Months later, it is still quietly sitting where I left it (it'd be totally freaky if it randomly moved) and is still faithfully fulfilling its purpose in life. I'd say it's a win! Good job cable?!? 🙂"
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Thomas & Jessii,5577,661,"This cable checks the boxes for an HDMI cable: good quality, long enough for the job, and cheap. For some reason HDMI cables continue to be more expensive than they should be, and too often devices don't come with one, even if they are sorely needed. I've been using this cable for literally years now without any issues. A great buy!"
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Damn Yankee,262,105,"I was moving and knocked my Wife's 32"" monitor/TV off her desk; one of these cables stopped the TV from hitting a tile floor and almost certainly destroying it. The cable was bent where it connects to the TV but it did not break. It is a Samsung TV and weighs almost nothing so your mileage may vary. This cable works and works well here to replace the broken one and buy a spare; it is much cheaper to buy more than one. Highly recommended, solid 5 stars."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,James,61,24,"This HDMI cable does its job admirably. Please don't buy into the hype of fancy gold plated, Kevlar coated cables like Monster and the like. Any high speed HDMI cable will carry a 4K signal and a $60 cable will work the same as a $10 one. They might have better build quality or use nicer materials but their job is to carry a signal and any cable will do that about the same as another. This Amazon Basics cable is a great value and feels like it will last a long time. I've had it connecting my PS4 to my 4K TV for more than a year and have had zero problems to speak of. If you need an HDMI cable and want to save a little money to put towards a better soundbar or TV instead of a fancy $50 cable then this one will work just fine."

But then I quickly though to check the hdmi cable first. The cable being used was an AmazonBasics High-Speed cable same as this and I checked my orders and it was almost 7 years old! Boy, that was a good amount of quality use to get from the cable. I quickly ordered the now of course greatly updated High-Speed HDMI cable and right away blu ray player has been fine and the picture quality also improved. I am always so thankful to get such amazing quality at such a great price. Highly recommend this cable."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,JWalch,265,363,I bought this HDMI extension cable to extend the length of the HDMI cable on my second monitor and it solved my problem perfectly. It's well constructed and should stand up to a lot of hard use. My furry companions like to play with wires so I especially appreciated the thick neopreme jacket thet encloses the individual conductors. Both the male and female connectors fit tightly with no play in either of them which ensures good data transmission. I will be buying more of these in the future as the need arises.
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,A. Miller,160,74,"I used this because my smart TV quit being so smart after a lightening strike. I was in a pinch because the final season of GoT was coming on in a week and my TV refused to stream anything or accept streaming from my computer. My choice was to buy a whole new smart TV or to buy this reasonably priced cable. I got it in the 25 ft option, so I wouldn't have to drill a hole in the wall between the computer room and living room. One of my tech-savvy buddies said to buy the cheapest HDMI cable, because buying an expensive one was a waste of money (they don't have a better picture or sound). He was right. This one gave us a perfect quality video and sound and was very easy to use. Pro tip: disconnect your speakers on your computer to get the sound to travel to your TV."

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Avid Reader,604,67,"The Amazon Basics High-Speed HDMI cable is a good cable at a very good price. I recently replaced my stereo receiver and upgraded to all-HDMI connections between the components using these cables. They are high-speed and handle 4K video from the Amazon Fire TV device to the receiver and then to the 4K TV without any problems. Video from the other components (CD/DVD/BR player, Cable TV box) works equally well over these cables.  Tip: You might need a longer cable than you realize. I thought 3-foot cables would be fine, but once I started running them I realized there wasn't any slack left to pull components out of the cabinet etc, so 6-foot cables were the better choice."

No loss in signal, no need for a booster - and that's with having a small display port to HDMI adapter on one of them.  These are pretty thick cables so be aware of that if you're planning on making any sharp turns with them. Overall though, couldn't be happier."

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Benjie B,209,138,Great 4K cables but these shouldn’t be called high speed from amazonbasics. They aren’t when it comes to technology now. The ones I received wouldn’t go over 9gbs. Whenever 18+ is what is necessary for atmos and 4K together. I would say that these are the best bang for your buck though when it comes to cheap 4K needs like just plugging into a tv with no high end hdr or color pitch. Also- if you have a need for enhanced sound passed 5.1 surround- I would also stay into the 18gb+ range.  A small tip... stay away from Samsung tv’s if you want Dolby Atmos unless you want to buy a decent splitter and three decent $20 cables.

After looking at multiple different options, i kinda figured 'what the hell' when it came to the amazon basics, it pretty much matched the competition on materials and specs, excluding one offer that had a braided cable... which in this purpose given i won't be moving the cable often, seemed to be kinda pointless.  As expected the cable did its job wonderfully and i have no complaints when it comes to it! I would easily recommend this to a friend just looking for a cable to get especially for the price and the fact the delivery was super speedy."

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,William I. Gordon,54,46,"It took me longer than it should have to get this cable, but once I got it, I couldn't have been more pleased. I didn't realize it was a combination HDMI/Ethernet cable, so it's considerably thicker than your standard cable. I don't have a current use for the Ethernet functionality, but I'm glad I have it should I have need of it in the future. I needed a long HDMI to connect the ARC port of my Roku TV to my home theatre received, located some distance away. It does everything it's supposed to do, enabling machine control from the TV the receiver and carrying the audio. I have always bought Amazon Basics HDMI cables because the ones in the big box stores are priced outrageously, and I have never been disappointed. With this most recent purchase, that continues to be the case. Buy without fear. This is the good stuff."

I was dismayed at the prices of the selection at Brick and Mortars, which were in some cases 5 times the cost of this. What I got surprised me, plugs on the ends, nice thick cabling, works great for a budget price."

I got the 25ft one. And I over compensated hahaha. I needed it to reach our couch to plug into an adapter then into the Macbook. It’s way to long. The cord itself is thick and feels strong. It’s still bendable though. It’s feels like it’s strong and will last a while. The HDMI plug at the end is, well, and HDMI plug. It looks like any other. It gets the job done. It has some weight to it when you hold the whole cord rolled up. It is 25ft though. I definitely recommend this HDMI cord to anyone who needs one. Fairly priced and seems of good quality!!"

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Yev C,19,10,"The 25 ft (7.6M) HDMI cable from amazon basics does what it should and was surprisingly thicker than expected. At first I considered it a drawback but in reality it simply means its well shielded. Because of the extra shielding, it won't have any issues if it rests on or along power cables (even though you should try to keep them from touching).  Lastly, I'm slightly annoyed that amazon bundles all the reviews together for a range of products. The shorter cables and longer cables are very different things. That being said, I've used a variety of amazon basics HDMI and displayport cables over the years and never had an issue with any of them."

For some reason the image from my Tivo was pixelated and I traced the issue to the HDMI cable. It seems that the Denon did a better job than the Pioneer at handling this quality issue. So I ordered the AmazonBasics HDMI cable and, not only did it take care of the problem, it significantly improved the overall quality of the image: crispier, better color. I'm very happy with this cable and I ordered more to replace other older HDMI cables."

I have more expensive cables with gold tips on multiple TVs in the house, but found that because the HDMI ports on my TVs require them to be plugged in horizontally instead of vertically, the more expensive thicker and heavier cables that I had would droop and lose connection briefly at times (very annoying if you are watching football!). So after changing out to this cable, no more brief disconnect problems. My big screen TVs catch all the football action now without bleeping out. The picture is top quality, too."

I found that the cable I bought supports 4K at 60Hz, but only if HDR is disabled. When HDR is enabled, the cable only supports 30Hz. I was initially disappointed, but apparently HDMI up to 2.0 specs can only support 30hz with 4K HDR with RGB, so this cable appears to perform with the latest support."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Kyle W Bingham,0,1,"Before I bought this, I feel like I was living a lie.  I love televisions. I also love my Playstation 4. Before I got this AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI 6 foot cable, I would do what I expect most people would do. I would turn on my system and imagine what was probably going on inside of it. I have a large TV, so it was always easy for me to picture Netflix, Hulu, or what ever game I think I have. I have spent hours on the couch just staring at the TV, imagining all sorts of things.  Unfortunately, my imagination eventually ran out.  I heard about this product online that allows your TV to read the code inside the Playstation and display it, similar to a sci-fi device that allows people to read dreams. It seemed too simple. A small black cord that promised so much. Obviously I was skeptical, but I ordered it anyway. When it arrived, I plugged it in, trying not to get my hopes up. Oh. My. God. The colors, the sounds, it was everything I could have hoped for. I was able to see exactly what I was trying to see and play on the screen!  After hooking up this HDMI cable to my TV and plugging it into my Playstation (or my Switch when I'm feeling really crazy) I've never looked back. I wish I would have known sooner, and I can't wait to tell my friends and family. It took my TV from static to fantastic. I can't imagine anyone going back to the way I used to do things."

You would buy TV and then they would hit you with that HDMI cord that was 3 feet in some instances not even 6 feet for 50 bucks. Well those days are long gone and of course Amazon was always ahead of the curve when it comes to that. When I first got a flatscreen TV that did not come with HDMI cable it was a smaller one I bought a $50 cable. That’s when my brother in law told me return it and went to Amazon got it for 10 or $12 back then

They come in a variety of lengths and work like a charm. I haven't had any comparability problems or issues with not being able to plug in.  If you have a $10K TV and another $10K in A/V gear, you may want to spring for gold plated, unicorn hair shielded cables. If you are like 99% of home theater users, these will be perfect."

You should go with more expensive brands of you need more length but if it's just going a few feet end to end...

In general I find them to be reliable and I'm more comfortable buying an Amazon branded product than a product from an unknown manufacturer. I realize that all of these things are made in a factory probably somewhere in Shenzhen, China, but I have come to believe that Amazon doesn't put its name on things that are junky. There is no point in spending a lot of money for an HDMI cable but there is a good case to be made for replacing older cables with newer versions. This year I replaced all of my HDMI cables with High Speed cables and this pair was an excellent value."

The important thing is that these cables are fully HDMI 2.0 compliant with their 18Gbps and 4K60Hz support. Word of advice, as long as the manufacturer can promise 18Gbps or 4K60Hz, buying more expensive cables will not improve image quality as the signal is digital, unless it's the mCable or something like that.

Although these cables are marked high speed they did not work in my setup. I have a Vizio M65-E0 TV, Onkyo TX-NR575 Receiver, Apple TV 4k and Xbox One S. With these cables hooked up my Xbox One S would not recognize my TV as being 4k HDR and the Apple TV 4k would not allow Dolby Vision. The receiver can pass HDR and Dolby Vision and my TV is capable of both as well. I also had issues displaying anything from the Xbox that was not 1080p such as DVDs etc. I was very frustrated and spent hours swapping settings and resetting all my gear. I finally decided to try some different cables. I purchased the Monoprice Certified cables also available on Amazon. Voila, everything was perfect. If you are looking to get 4k HDR or Dolby Vision out of your home theater setup passing through a receiver, I would recommend you steer clear of these cables and get the Monoprice Certified. They are only a few dollars more and much higher quality."

Games looked funny, like a mixture of blurry and pixelated. Then I tried this Amazon Basics cable. Text on the PS4 menu now looks smooth and easy on the eyes. Games are crisp and clear now. So I tested the cable that came with my PS4 Pro on a television with a bluray player...same thing; a blurry, pixelated image. That is a lot of signal denigration to take place over a six foot cable.

Keep in mind HDMI cables are not meant to be continuously plugged and unplugged. For that you should get a heavy duty one but I guarantee the port on the device will stop working before the cable gives out.

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,jspears,41,92,The Amazon Basics High-Speed HDMI Cable is a great value. The cords are sturdy and stay plugged in without issues. I can't tell a difference between these cables and the special gold coated ones my husband bought two years ago. I definitely recommend these cables.

I returned the soundbar to the manufacturer and he stated that everything worked flawlessly. He suggested trying new HDMI Cables. He suggested Monoprice or AmazonBasics. I decided to purchase the AmazonBasics. Its been three weeks with not one issue. Not one audio drop out no video drop outs, Awesome. Now I hope I didn't jinx myself by writing this review."

But strongly recommend these to anybody that needs to hook up monitors or TVs or whatever. Not only do I have them on my PC, but I also have mono TVs. Would recommend these to anybody looking for a solid an expensive HDMI cable."

Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,GD Buerky,59,115,"I like that they get the 'signal' from whatever device you connect them to and get it to whatever device you have on the receiving end. What else is there? I'm not highly critical as some might be. If the movie, game, etc. looks good on my TV and remains steady then I'm happy. Spending big bucks for HDMI cable is NOT necessary unless you are going long distances."

I looked around and I'm happy with the quality and build of the cable. The length of the cable is good as well. I'm using the other cable from this 2-pack bundle to connect the monitor I use for streaming to my desktop. Again, I'm really happy with the cable."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Jasmin,158,90,"Used this cable daily for months and months without issue. The picture quality is great. It stays in the ports when I need it to, and can be pulled out with ease. Amazon did it again with another good product."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Sean,2162,607,"If you still have anything hooked up to your HDTV with old AV cables, change them if you can. On a 60"" Sharp Aquos, there was a slight difference in picture. The real difference was with the audio. I had an old Bluray player for a long, long time. So long that it used to be hooked up to a tube TV. Back then they didn't include HDMI cables with a new purchase. Sound was always a bit muted, no matter how I adjusted it. Especially dialogue. On many movies, the sound effects would cover up what was being said. Not a problem now. I did this a while back with my PS3 and the difference was amazing. That time I bought the Sony cables. These Amazon cables are half the price but work just the same."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Mari Orozco,57,37,"There isn't really a need anymore to go to a big box stores and buy expensive HDMI cables when they're available on Amazon. I purchased this cable for a friend for their new 4K TV and WOW! The picture is clean, crisp, beautiful and bright! To test the cable we hooked up a PS4 pro to the TV and popped in a game. The textures, the movement of the camera and dimension was just amazing! I would recommend this cable to anyone looking for a quality HDMI cable that won't break the bank."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Jon,654,75,"You really need no better HDMI cables then this, buy anything more and it's just fluff money. From the most expensive home theater to a simple cable box/TV, these are perfect. Dont buy into hype and fallacies like you see from ""Mnstr Cabl"". All you need for HDMI is a solid connection, and the correct format of cable. Read before you buy and save some money!"
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Frans van Santbrink,29,26,"Works well. I did a lot of research on different HDMI cables and brands before I purchased this one. Seems to me there isn't much of a performance difference - if any - between cables like these from Amazon Basics compared to the rather expensive ones. Ideally, the main thing you'd want to be sure of is you get a High-Speed HDMI cable, which is exactly what this is. And of-course, one that is constructed properly.  I decided to get the pack of two because the price difference compared to just the one makes it a logical decision. Also, in that case I have a backup.  There's not much to say about these cables. They work, they're well built and I haven't had any issues since purchase. No need to spend $50+ on an HDMI cable that won't give you any difference in picture quality."
Amazon Basics CL3 额定高速 4K HDMI 电缆 - 6 英尺,Carlos,366,198,"I ordered 2 packs of 2 HDMI 2.0 cables from Amazon. They work rather well. I am using them for a PlayStation 4, a WiiU, an Apple TV 4th gen, and a late 2012 Mac Mini, with of course a 4K Sony Bravia TV 2016 Model with the upscale feature. So far the HDMI for the PS4 makes things look a bit better, sure it's just an HDMI cable but coming from version 1.3, this version 2.0 does the trick very nicely. One last thing I have to mention is, that I like the black color of the cable which matches the back of the TV very nicely.  -Amazon delivered very promptly. I literally ordered this on a Saturday and received them 2 days later on Monday, without 2 day shipping."

I ordered 2 at once, I have just use one of the two I purchase and so far the quality on the TV is as if I was using the TV itself. Excellent Quality in the image (HD), theres not delay in the signal, and my TV and laptop detected the cable right away.  So far a Highly recommended product :D"

I think any late model TV will be pretty much the case. I bought this to get the mute button, that was worth it to me.  UPDATE: When I first got this I didn't think I would use this feature that much but it is a game changer!

Not to search the Roku platform every time... Bad programming and needs to be updated."

Love that this voice remote is also enhanced so it doesn't need a clear path between the remote and the TV. The mute button is also a plus.  Installation was a breeze. The remote immediately paired with the TV after inserting the batteries.  Mine came with the following streaming channel buttons: Netflix, Hulu, Sling and ESPN+.  Will buy another one to replace my old Roku remote that doesn't have a mute button.  As an FYI, this remote does not have a earphone jack. No stars subtracted because I never used the jack anyway."

It(my ultra remote) does still work but weirdly because if you press any button, the volume will either turn up all the way or will turn down. I don't want to replace it but the volume button don't work anymore. This one works as the ultra but not quite. Just like the other review, I loved the bulky and heavy feel of the original one. The earphones jack is gone which is useful for me especially when I go home at night and everyone is asleep. Last but not the least, the remote finder is gone!!!! What??! I have kids and that thing was useful because they always misplace the remote! Now I gotta find the remote again like in the old daysss. I know I'm being a baby but to find the remote for nnth time a day is irritating. That's one of the reasons why we bought roku ultra in the first place. I just hope they make the exact same remote (for a replacement) as roku ultra has. I'd be first in line to buy it if they actually make one."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,David S. Seekins,151,22,"This official Roku branded remote works just like the one that came with your unit. It has the TV controls on it (on/off, vol up/down, and mute). It does not have the wireless sound (where you can plug earbuds into the remote). It does have ""voice control"", which honestly I personally just never can get any satisfactory results from. This remote does use the RF mode (vs the infrared) for the Roku control, so you don't have to point the remote at the unit if your unit supports the RFs remotes.  The one thing I want to point out is that some of the buttons, particularly the up/down/left/right pad, are not as sensitive as the original remote, requiring significantly more force on each direction to register a button bush. The first remote I received had really poor sensitivity on the ""up"" and ""left"", so I returned it. The replacement remote is better, but still requires more force on these buttons than my original remotes."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Jonathan M.

So unfortunately I'll be returning because I want to have one remote that controls my TV and the volume on the soundbar. Back to the old standard IR remote with no voice control for now.
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,LFM,1035,121,"As noted elsewhere, so I'm just joining the chorus: This remote worked beautifully with my TCL that originally shipped with an IR remote.  The IR remote was finicky and had to be aimed more carefully than any other in my electronics stack, and just using the tv was bugging the hell out of me every minute of every interaction. I was thinking of sending it back, it was so annoying. I might not even have thought there was a better way, except that I already had a TCL with a radio remote like this one, and it worked flawlessly.  Seriously, this thing is the difference between, ""I might have to send this TV back"" and ""I hope this TV lasts for years -- I love it."" And convincing a few friends to choose the same model. I do not get not including it from the beginning, but I'm sure there were price points to meet, bean counters to employ, production volumes to hit, something.  Of course, YMMV. Maybe it won't work with yours. But it worked with mine. And changing to this remote eliminated the only frustration I had every time I sat down to watch tv. Best dollar-to-life-upgrade value in tech I've had in a long while.  And it's really nice to know that a replacement is easy, if either remote ever dies or wanders off, too."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Kirbinster (Howard),700,299,"While I love my Roku TCL TV one of the things I have come to hate about it is the included remote must be pointed directly at the bottom center of the screen to work. This is a royal pain. This replacement remote works on RF signals rather than IR so now I no longer have to do that. I can aim it anywhere and it works perfectly. It took me all of about 30 seconds to link it up with the TV and am supper happy with it. I tried the voice function and that seems to work fine too, but I bought it just so I would no longer have to accurately point the remote at the TV."

I feared that the TV had gone past its sell-by date, but it's hard to find one that fits in the rather cramped space allotted to it. And it was the Roku remote that was really dying, so I ordered this one as a replacement.  It was full of instructions on how to pair it with a Roku TV, so I figured that Panasonic was a lost cause, but no! I generally leave it tuned to AUX, which is the Roku channel, so I turned the TV on (using the Panasonic remote) and behold! Up came a message that the two of them were pairing, and they did. The off/on button on the Roku remote worked just fine, as did the Mute button and the volume control -- and the voice control! When I was laughing so hard that I couldn't finish a command, I was told that We don't offer that feature yet. So I struggled to say Open and kept repeating myself. It said Thinking. Then it opened to a movie or TV show called, yes, Open!  So I've tossed the old remote and put the Panasonic remote where I can reach it in an emergency. I figure I've already got my twenty dollars' worth of entertainment out of this wonderful gadget."

I powered on the Roku while the batteries were not yet installed in the remote. As soon as the batteries were installed the pairing automatically began and it was up and running. I didn't even have to use the button under the cover, it simply auto-ran! The pairing process asked if I wanted my tv (Samsung 6001) to work with the remote, and when I indicated yes, it walked me through an easy volume setting process and now I can power on/off my tv, adjust volume, and use mute all from the new remote. I don't use the voice command option, as I simply prefer the buttons. Love it!"

My remote disappeared due to the kids not knowing where it was. Of course, I hit the buy button and Amazon dropped it off in a couple of days. Wow, this thing has a great feel over my default Roku TV remote. The buttons are soft silicone, the buttons all feel tactile and have a good feel when you press and depress buttons for any action. The Voice portion is good but it doesn't make the right choices all the time. I think it's a work in progress and will get better once it ""learns"" and trains from your voice and from the network. Even without the voice, entering letters for movie titles and searches is easier. I really wish they would bring back the short mini keyboard remote for roku TVs but I think the end game is to remove this and be totally dependent on voice. (I must be old).  If you have doubts, best 20 bucks I've spent in a while."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,chris ellis,127,145,This is a great remote but it's not great dane proof. Every time I go somewhere for an extended amount of time this big old Great Dane wants to chew on my remote like it's a bone. Now these Great Danes are upward of 130 lb and got a mouth about as big as a hog Saturday's remotes just can't stand up to it. I believe they made one out of titanium I would pay the extra cost to keep from having to buy it every week. People has told me to get rid of the dog but I enjoy the wild boar hunting too much to get rid of her. As an expensive as they are I figure I would just buy a few until I got her trained. I thought about it one time and have concluded that she probably smells the bore sent on the remote from my hands and think she's going to get a treat if she destroys it. Nevertheless I'll keep buying them until I can find one that's made out of titanium and then I guess I'll be buying her a new set of teeth.
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Drew,55,24,Roku remotes generally do not have to be pointed directly at some thing to work because they use the WIFI. You would think the company would know this and not have pictures of people pointing a remote because that makes it confusing. This remote does not require an infrared sensor but it does have the infrared capability so that I can also function as a volume remote for some TVs. The reason I mention this is that I had an old Roku 2 that needed to have the remote it came with pointed at it because it came with a cheap IR only remote. But this one works without needing to be pointed.  The volume control will only work on certain TVs not some sound bars.  The voice recognition is good but it seems Roku has changed how it handles voice recognition. I don’t think I would blame the remote if the voice recognition was not working. That would probably be something with how rohu treats the voice and words that you use.
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,cherijean,172,99,"First of all I received this item early...big plus...It works great with my Roku Stick. I want to leave info on how it works so you won't have to go through what I did. First of all on the instruction sheet there is nothing on how to connect to a Roku Stick. Most would get this as a replacement, I myself got it so I could have a remote on my side of the bed. Here are the directions to pair your remote to your stick. Follow these directions, it is so easy..if you have put your batteries in your new remote..remove them. If you still have your remote that came with your Roku Stick use it to do the following, Go to settings>system>power>system restart>restart. When your roku device displays the Home screen..insert batteries in your new remote. point towards tv wait 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes connection...you should see on the screen ""pairing"" when that disappears your new remote should be paired. So far it works great...I love the volume control...haven't tried the voice remote part yet. I hope this helps."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Filmbilly,16,42,"This works great, once you get it connected fully. When I first connected it it controlled my Roku tv with the buttons but the voice function would not work. So I held the button on the inside of the remote's battery compartment for 5 seconds to redo the pairing to the TV (just like the directions say to.). Second time still didn't work, but the third time it worked! So, if it connects but the voice function doesn't work, try repairing it. Like I said it took three tries before it worked for me. Now it works great.  And you can do a lot with the voice control. You can launch any channel/app, you just have to say the app/channels exact full name as it is listed. You can do searches for actors, directors, and categories like ""Romantic Comedies from the 80s"" and it will search and find a bunch. Also, if you are in a channel like Netflix and you do a search it will search Netflix first for what you are looking for but if it doesn't find it in Netflix it will then say no results in Netflix and attempt to search all the Roku channels - but it does give you a cancel option.  Oh, and It does NOT use WIFI! Once I paired it to my Roku Tv I checked my Router and it did not come up as a device on my wifi. I'm pretty sure it's some kind of RF connection because you don't have to point it right at the TV. I actually tested it several ways and even covered the remote under my hands and it still controlled the TV."

Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Sun Bum,300,87,"I didn’t realize this model uses the home network to communicate with the TV rather than IR when I ordered. It’s wonderful to be anywhere in the room with the remote and be able to increase the volume, change the channel, etc. For those reviewers who complain it is slower than their old remote, it is most likely they don’t realize this remote uses the home wireless network. If their home equipment is slow or overloaded, it will be slow for this remote. And even if the network is fast, it will be slower going through the network than for a direct IR signal pointed at the TV. But for me, the increased delay is not noticeable enough to care. The convenience factor is fantastic! The glazed surface of the remote is ‘slip free’, compared to the smooth surface of the original remote. I prefer the smooth surface, simply because it seems like I can keep it clean easier than the glazed surface, but that’s a minor complaint.  Great remote!  And one other possible reason the remote might not work for you is if you forget to change the TV settings to ‘fast start’. The remote will ONLY work if the TV setting is on ‘Fast Start’."

I even had another from our old TCL tv and that one also stopped working. I did everything and nothing worked. I even bought new ones and they worked for half a day then stopped. I noticed all of them were IR signaled. So something is happening with my TVs IR receiver. My Roku app remote worked flawlessly and that is over WiFi. I verified this with my bedroom Roku remote that is WiFi signaled and paired it with my TV and it also worked but it doesn't have volume on it. So I pulled went ahead and searched for WiFi Roku remotes that work with Roku TVs and this one came up. Decided on this one since it's from Roku and has voice search. It's a bit pricey but after spending so much time buying the first ones and returning, the price is reasonable. I just turned on my TV and inserted the batteries on the new remote. Within seconds it was automatically pairing. Works like a charm and I can control the volume now. People are saying it doesn't work but who knows if they are actually reading to see if it will work for their devices. I know for sure it will work for a TCL Roku TV."

If it did, it would be perfect.  By using Roku, we can choose what content we want without paying for all the garbage channels on cable.  I purchased this remote as a replacement for our current one because our volume control stopped working. Everything else was working, so I thought perhaps we had worn out the volume buttons. However, before our new one could arrive (schedule to arrive tomorrow) my son looked it up on the Internet and discovered it may just need to be re-set or reconfigured with the television. He was able to do that in a couple of minutes and our old one is now working fine again. I haven't decided whether to keep the replacement or return it.  But if your choice is cable or Roku, I highly recommend Roku. We have the model with the stick that plugs into the TV and it works wonderfully for us."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Professor Chaos,162,62,"This is a great remote to replace or upgrade your Roku remote. If you've lost or damaged an old remote, this is probably your best bet when compared to the cheaper basic versions or the higher end rechargeable version. This is an RF remote, so it does not require line of sight like the IR remotes do. That's why I mention it's an upgrade for those that might have a Roku version that needs line of sight with the included remote. The higher end rechargeable remote I have heard that it requires recharging too frequently and Roku really missed the mark by not including USB C on it, so this version is what I recommend for most people."

I purchased my TCL from Costco to get the best price; I saved several hundred dollars, but did not get the voice remote.

My box stopped freezing, the remote always works and I love the weight and feel of it. I don’t use the voice recognition much but it does work. I’m just happy it only cost me $20 to have my Roku experience being top notch again.  On a side note, my sister did just get the Roku Premiere and it works great too, so I would’ve shelled out for that if this didn’t fix the issue. All the same, I’d like to commend Roku for keeping their products compatible with older editions rather than forcing people to upgrade completely. Makes me that much more loyal and likely to recommend to others."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Positronic Brain,665,626,"It only took us a month to lose the remote to our Roku Premiere but in the end it's good that we did. As a replacement this Voice Remote adds several features we didn't have. The big 3 are RF communication with the Roku, voice search, and TV controls. - The default Roku Premiere remote uses old-timey IR communication which requires you to keep the Roku somewhere exposed and to point the remote at it. This Voice Remote fixes that by using RF to talk to the Roku. - The Voice Remote, as the name implies, lets you do voice search with an included microphone and the button to use it. Much quicker than typing out your searches, but it's only really useful on the home screen search, not inside channels like Netflix. - TV controls are awesome since the only buttons I really use on the TV remote are power and volume. The Roku remote can control those on the TV (with super easy setup). This lets me shove the old TV remote in a drawer and just use one.  I'm pretty happy that this one isn't just a replacement, but also an upgrade."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Igotmail,54,89,I love this remote. It’s easy to use once you get the hang of it. I wanted it for finding movies instead of typing it out and seeing where it was playing. This does it for you. Just say the name of the movie or if you want a certain actor like Elvis Presley just say “Elvis Presley movies” and all his movies will show up that will play on your apps. If you don’t say movies and you have pandora it will go pandora and play his music.  I have a roku tv so it’s very compatible with the remote. I just put in the batteries and it connected to the tv without doing anything else.  Have fun with it!
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Amy Sparkles,10,14,"I bought this as a replacement remote after I was betrayed by gravity; as it dropped my former remote off of a table for no reason, and with conviction (if you know, you know). I didn't know if it would work, but I thought the idea was cool, but it ended up being my favorite Amazon purchase that I'd ever made. It was easy to install, easy to use, and no setup was was needed to use the features. Can I give more stars? Work on that Amazon. Plus, it was delivered quickly. It was almost here before I'd actually decided on ordering it (a joke, don't think this seller is a psychic). I'd suggest it for anyone. Even that elderly person in your life that you'd usually have to tape the entire remote off except the channel buttons for. Yes, it's that easy."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Crosscut Saw,19,36,"OMG I gotta tell you this remote is a life saver. My original TCL Roku TV remote died and for the life of me I couldn't find an OEM replacement, so I bought a 'compatible' weird-brand one the kind you see on Amazon a lot, for like 15 bucks or something like that. That particular one suckkkeeed. Terrible. I was resigned to use the phone Roku app as a remote for a while. Then I came across this one and rolled the dice even though I don't have voice control on the old one. After pairing it, it worked!! The buttons are so much smoother. Highly recommend."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Richard S,396,294,"I bought this for a TCL Roku tv where the infrared (IR) remote response was flaky. The TV responded randomly to any button on the IR remote. This Roku remote works with RF and has to be paired. Once paired, it works perfect. Now, every time I press a key, whether pointed at the TV or not, the TV responds with no problems. Although the IR worked, this remote is so much better I'm surprised TCL tv does not use them as original equipment instead as a replacement. Anyway, minor irritant removed, problem resolved."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,DoubleFault,114,42,"Unlike the remote control that came with my (and two of my friends) built in ROKU TV, this one works. Comparing notes, all three of us were totally dissatisfied with the stock remote that came with our ROKU TV's. They all were iffy at best with a button input. This remote is not IR so you don't have to point it at the TV and every input to the TV is instantaneous. Pairing to the TV with built in ROKU was a breeze. Go to settings - Remotes and devices - pair new device - remote. Push button under battery compartment. In less than 15 seconds it was paired and working. Shame on ROKU for selling the OEM junk that comes with TV's that have built in ROKU."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,BluesBrother,976,139,"This replacement control is identical in form and function to the original with one very important difference: it has a Mute button which can be used to instantly silence the TV.  My original Roku worked fine, except I had no way to mute the sound and there is no good work-around. Finally, the lack of this capability became sufficiently annoying that I purchased this replacement control - just to get the Volume Mute function.  This is a feature that *should* have been included in the design of the original remote, but was overlooked (note: the new 2020 Roku devices have a redesigned remote that includes the Mute button). But I shouldn't have had to BUY another remote just to get this obviously missing functionality."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Mike L,297,206,"I tried a couple of the cheap knockoffs and while they seemed to be well made, they lacked the radio signal option. The cheap IR only ones must have direct line of sight to work which is of no use to us since our Roku is in a closed cabinet. Even if we used an IR repeater like we have for other equipment, once you've used the radio version you just don't want to go back!  This oem unit quickly synced up and worked fine. Hopefully it doesn't learn to walk and disappear like the original one!"
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Ernie,144,341,"I love the remote the RF works great, even when pointing in another direction away from TV. I use it for games like Solitaire, and I am constantly Hitting the Mute Button, which Would not matter on solitaire since there is no sound, it just has an icon of a speaker which keeps blinking on and off, which is distracting after awhile, You cannot hold this remote to press the buttons, without Hitting the Mute button, it should be placed above the Volume Buttons. all other functions including voice control work great!"
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Ray G.,0,7,"I have used this for 2 months as of writing this review. I use it on a a TV with ROKU built-in. I couldn't stand my old remote having to be pointed directly at the TV for it to work properly. This works no matter which direction the remote is pointing. The voice function has worked in every app I used and can be used for very specific commands like opening a specific show on a specific app (I mostly use Netflix and Hulu). I waited to review this because other reviews said this product eats batteries or breaks easily. So far it's still using the same batteries and works as well as when I opened it. I did give it 5 stars but I do have 1 criticism and it's that the volume and mute button is on the side of the remote instead of the top, which is not preferred. I'm happy with the purchase and think it's well worth it at the price point I paid which was about 19.88$."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Lady Dollar Watcher,143,26,"It is more ergo-friendly than the one that came with the TV -- easier to hold.  I still don't like the ""quick buttons"" that get you to channels I don't use because they can be accidentally pushed and bounce you off of what you are watching. Some people must like them or Roku gets a kickback for placing them there. Every remote we've had for Roku (6) have different quick buttons -- popularity of channels change. Reaching for the remote to pause or mute it and if your finger slips, you're off what you were watching.  Still, this was a cheap fix to our remote issue or having to open and unlock my iphone to use the remote app just to pause something."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Alex Redmon,17,32,I bought this remote as a replacement to the original one that came with my TV. It should be noted that you have to get to the main roku screen. My old remote stopped working so I downloaded the app. In the app you can work through it as a guest to get to the home screen and under the settings tab pair the new remote. You will also realize that the app remote is the same as rhe voice remote. So if you don't need a physical remote get the app.

For some reason, this one seems better built than the one we got with our streaming stick +... I literally took it out of the box, put the battery in it, and it worked... so, if you've broken the original remote, lost it, whatever, JUST BUY THIS! You won't regret it!"
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,mmccoy2000,62,13,"So, I decided to spend a few extra $$$ to get an actual Roku remote, purchased from Roku via Amazon, to ensure it would pair with my Roku Express+ device. So much for that idea! According to Roku's Amazon listing, the remote pairs with Roku Express and Roku Express +. That said, I saw an asterisk (*) appearing after Roku Express and Roku Express +. At the very bottom of the listing, there was a link directed to Roku's website and a list a numerous compatible model numbers for the Roku Express & Express +. Now, I had no idea there were so many different model numbers b/c even Roku typically just refers to the devices as the Roku Express or Roku Express+. You're hard pressed to learn which model number you actually have. And yet, somehow I must've figured out that I had the Roku Express+ 3700x. I then compare my model number to the list on Roku's website. And though 3700x wasn't listed, there were numerous model versions which predated (and postdated) my 3700x that were listed. I therefore mistakenly assumed that my device, falling squarely within the range of earlier and later devices (based on model numbers before and after 3700x) would also be compatible. After all, later versions of the same device don't typically regress or have less capability, right? Unless it's a defect of some sort. In the end, this remote DOES NOT WORK w/version 3700x, though it allegedly will with other versions of the same device! Here's an idea Roku...to the extent that you create dozens of models for the exact same device (yet simply refer to them categorically as ""Roku Express"" or ""Express +""), a great number of which - in no certain order - are compatible with new remotes, how about you make it easier on us and spell out precisely which model numbers ARE NOT compatible. Otherwise, we're left to speculate on (1) which model we have, and (2) whether our model number, being one that falls within the range of a dozen others, is also compatible given the seemingly incongruent yet blanket statement: ""Compatible with Roku Express & Roku Express +"". I want my money, but most importantly, MY TIME back."

Changing my review to five stars.  Works great, when it works. Have owned two for less than a week and have had to re-pair both of them at least once in order to control power and volume on my TV. Saw others reporting this problem on Roku's site. Pairing is quick but shouldn't need to be done more than once. To control the Roku box itself, it works perfectly.Keep your original remote handy - you'll need it.  Update 4/1/21: Have had to re-pair both remotes twice in less than a week."

I like that it is wi-fi connected so I don’t have to point it directly at the Roku to operate it. I can control the TV volume and turn it on and off with this remote. Definitely an upgrade over my old one. I don’t use voice control much but it’s nice to have. I’m very happy with this remote."

I took one out of its package and before I could put the battery door back on the remote, it had already paired with my TV. I didn't have to do anything else, and it's working, voice commands are great. The same with both televisions. I will say you could keep the old remote next to you until pairing is complete. Then I put them away in a drawer and that's it, my new remotes are cool. Also note that the four preselected buttons may not be what you have on your old remote, it may be Disney instead of VUDU, etc."

The remote supplied with my TCL Roku Tv stopped working, and I spent the money for this one- $20.00 is more than other replacements-but I wanted the extra feature of the voice control. This works perfectly. The pairing was super easy. And the voice activation is very responsive. When the TV is off, pressing one of the preset buttons like HULU or Sling will turn the tv on and take it to that app. This remote also does not seem to require the remote to be pointed precisely at the front of the Tv. So far, I am very happy with this remote."

This remote works perfectly with my TV, it doesn't even need to be facing the TV to work as I believe it has a remote connection with the TV rather then using IR. The voice control on the remote understands everything I have thrown at it. From launching different apps on the TV, all the way to playing specific shows on those apps, like asking it to open a movie on Netflix when still on the home screen. It also feels as it is built very well, hopefully my dog wont get to this remote either."

Now, you press the microphone button on the remote and tell ROKU what you want to see. After a moment of thinking about it, your results appear on the screen. It may give odd results if you're Scottish, so try to avoid that. Voice-operated equipment is prohibited in Scotland due to the dangers of misinterpretation."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Pat,21,51,What an awesome remote!!! I was hoping that the preset buttons would have at least 2 of the Roku channels I use and I’m glad it did. It came with a remote and was super simple to set up as my tv automatically detected it once I put in the batteries. Bonus that I don’t have to point the remote directly at the tv for it to work. It’s very comfortable in my small hands and the buttons aren’t super far apart.

The buttons push so softly and are quick to respond on the TV. This is 100% better than the original remote that actually came with my TV.

I contemplated on purchasing this for a few days and finally said ok let’s do it. Voice control is awesome, design is great, you can even use the voice control to do the volume!

I also discovered that Roku makes a remote control smartphone app that works via WiFi. That worked great too but only needed it for about an hour. These guys are awesome!"

It feels significantly higher in quality, and the buttons have a satisfying and solid feel to them. This improved your TV experience so much, I cannot recommend this any more highly."

This isn't a huge deal as the remote app on my phone can now support that but it is a difference. The buttons are quieter than the original remote which is always a plus, that clicking can get on your nerves when you are scrolling trying to find something. Setup was easy and seamless.

The second remote is being used on a TV that has ROKU. The TV came with an IR remote that was a pain because you couldn't control the TV/ROKU unless you were directly in front of the TV.

Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,M. Dippel,458,81,"I'm a *huge* Roku user (owned an N1, two models of one of the second gens, currently use a 3, 4 and a TCL Roku TV between two homes).  For my TCL TV, I was using a WiFi remote and an IR remote. The WiFi remote has no power button, and this TV performs terribly via IR, frequently missing clicks with direct aim on fresh batteries (not sure if it's remote or receiver).  This was to replace that (with the loss of the earphone port, to boot). Paired easily and worked for a few days, then only ""worked"" via IR (similarly poor performance, so i'm assuming it's the TV). To my surprise, though, it drained the batteries that came with it a few weeks later. i've now been through at least two sets of batteries since i've purchased it. I have *several* WiFi-based remotes, all use AA, rather than AAA batteries, and while none last anywhere as long as a regular IR remote, they'd last longer than the 8-or-so pack that I was replacing. This is the second replacement from this pack and will rapidly represent the vast majority of my household AAA battery purchasing.  When it gets disconnected, the TV has to be rebooted to reconnect (the ""pair a device"" menu just hangs, probably software, will probably be fixed at some point). Even though I *gave up* on reconnecting WiFi, it *still* blew threw the last set of batteries.  So... it's an over-priced remote that will result in you spending well over that price in batteries over it's (hopefully short) lifetime."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Laskins,12,29,"This voice control remote makes it so much easier to find a TV program. Being a senior, I haven't memorized the stations where which each program appears. So, I simply ask for a program and the remote takes me directly to it This is so much easier than hunting a program down. For example, is New Amsterdam on ABC, NBC, CBS? No worry, just say ""New Amsterdam"" and it take you to it."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Amazon Customer,1,3,"The OEM remote that came with my Roku 2 died an unfortunate death when a battery exploded in it - was worried with so many reviews that some available remotes are cheaply made or don't work with older model Roku's. This one works perfectly, is not cheaply made, and came with batteries.  It's updated from my previous as it has voice control, can control my tv (so I can ditch the 2nd tv remote!) and has updated fast click buttons for hulu, netflix, disney. My previous remote had radio disney, which ended in 2015, if that tells you how old that remote was!  I was able to check for compatability with the website, but it is listed wrong in the item description - there is no space between ""remote"" and ""check"". Go to: go.Roku.com/remotecheck and it was pretty easy to figure out which once I needed."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Nick,29,51," It has to be visible by the Roku to work, bit working through my leg, not working through a blanket, not even working through my TV, I had to pull the box forward. Not what I paid for and not impressed. E-waste, I'll just use my phone 99.9% of the time."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Cash,55,82,"We're always misplacing our remotes so I bought two extra remotes, this and a $6.97 one, for our TCL TVs. I like the feel of this one better than the original remote. The $6.97 one works fine but has no voice. I like the official one here."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,JC Cooper,236,80,"After almost 3 years of searching for a Roku replacement remote, they have finally released one that works with the streaming stick. It's not perfect because it didn't recognize my Panasonic TV so I can't use the volume control but it paired with my TV and I can use it for what it was intended. I was skeptical at first but trust me, it works!"
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Pkinc,355,209,"No more selecting characters one at a time to search, just press a button on this remote and speak in your choices. It does not do well with long sentences, keep your commands short, such as youtube yoga. If you just say yoga, you will get choices available across all Roku channels."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Daniel Uitti,41,37,"I use a ROKU that does not use an IR Remote. Buying a ROKU brand remote for a regular ROKU is the only thing that works. A 3rd party remote might not work. This remote works and is programed to my ROKU exactly like the original remote. It is great to have a second remote - or replacement remote. With a decent TV that is no a SMART TV, this is perfect."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Louis Fristensky,61,31,"My dog ate my other remote. Originally, I had purchased a universal remote not knowing that it would not work with one of those Roku sticks in the back of my TV. As a result, I had to purchase this remote. Though it upset me to have to buy another remote, this remote was affordable. It was easy to connect to my current Roku system and works perfectly. Now I just need to be sure to keep it away from my dog."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Jo Faust,0,3,"I love the Roku tv's but the remote is lacking numbers. This makes it harder to change channels. With this voice controlled remote, everything is SO easy. You can even say things like ""Find movies with Diane Keaton"" and they all pop up. I got this to make it easier for my mother to use the new tv and it is totally doing that. I bought a TCL 4 series tv and this works great. Also, you don't have to point it directly at the tv to change channels like the one that came with the TV. For $20, this was a great purchase!"
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Elle L,66,70,"We lost our Roku remote & struggled to find one that worked properly. This one does. Yes, it is more expensive, yet it is an actual Roku brand remote that works well. I like that it also has mute button. I recommend spending extra money on this Roku brand remote."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Stearns19,142,115,"The voice command capability facilitates using Roku and it's feature set. Command ""launch"" an app. and it launches. It would be nice if it could also launch the sub applications. Perhaps a future version. It makes searching for tv shows and movies a breeze. If the search result is on an app not residing on the Roku host, it will seek and install the app so that the object may be utilized. Well done Roku."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Mk18_AR,179,177,"I don't know why, but it seems like there's plenty of replacement remote options for Roku TVs, but very few for the Streaming Stick. This one works very well. It automatically paired with the stick and the Vizio TV within seconds and works great."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,Wahoo Patty,238,103,"Awesome remote, perfect for Roku TV. My new TCL Roku TV remote quit working less than a month after purchase, replaced it with this one. This one is actually better than the one that came with TV because it has voice search!! Paired easily with TV. I would highly recommend to anyone with Roku TV. And of course it will work with my other Roku devices too. Win, win. Thank you."
Roku 语音遥控器(官方)适用于 Roku 播放器、Roku 电视和 Roku Streambar,LN,823,757,"Finally a remote for my Roku 3 that also works with my 10+ year old Samsung tv. I'm thrilled, I can control my tv volume and power and I can use voice search. I'm very happy, so happy I've bought another as a backup."
