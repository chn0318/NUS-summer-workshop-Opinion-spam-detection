"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I've had this for about a year now and I use this phone mount every time I ride my bike. For the price it is about unbeatable. Initially, I was worried that on heavy trails or when going over bumps, the phone might come loose but the design is very secure and not once has my phone come loose. The straps that secure the phone can accidentally press the side buttons on the phone but once you are aware of this its pretty easy to slide the straps on without getting close to the buttons. One very slight drawback - there are times when I'm riding and want to take a picture with my phone. Removing the phone from the flexible straps takes a little doing and sometimes I miss the picture, but I'm not sure any design that secures the phone safely would also be easy to free up. Overall it is an excellent product."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I bought this for my motorcycle. It's a custom bike and I use a cruise around at 80 to 90 miles an hour. One thing I love is the fact that it fits my handlebars because they're pretty big and they give you two different sizes for handlebars. They also give you multiple sizes for your phone. It's not only great to get extra pieces but they're also sturdy as hell. And then there's the fact that you know that your phone is secure or not going to blow off the bike especially when our phones cost 800 to $1,200"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I use this with my IPhone Xs for mountain biking on rough trails and have never had the phone come loose, even after small jumps. I had it loosen part way after a crash, but it didn’t come out of the corner straps. I love that I can use my trail mapping app and Strava and have all the functions of my phone, while ditching the old bike computer, which had limited functionality anyhow. I liked mine so much that I gave one to my son and daughter, who also bike with me. They both love the upgrade over the old bike computer. The pivot needs to be tight to keep your phone from tilting, but it can be done with a light rotation with pliers (wrap a rag around the socket screw to protect the plastic and don’t over-tighten)."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",I really was worried this would be a junk product. I installed and tested it with an older junk smart phone. At just over 80 mph noticed no movement at all. Took the bike back home grabbed my phone and took a few shall we say test rides. Then hit the freeway and repeated my 80 mph test. The iPhone was bigger and it was still holding well in place. Now I don't suggest this but I opened the bike up to over 100 and still held not a wiggle. As I usually ride slow and easy im sure my bike was saying really knock this off. But I'm confident in the product. Even came with extra tie downs so I'd they begin to become questionable you can change them out. Well designed and prefect for me.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I have this on my BMW motorcycle. If you are looking for the best, this is the one. This is my second one as the other ones shown on Amazon do NOT have the thumbs screw to tighten on the bar. This phone mount is easy to install no tools required like the other brands. Plus I got three rubbers in the box, in case one breaks to hold the phone, this set-up will last for years. My other one I purchased from a different vendor broke, hence I needed a replacement, this is THE ONE> and no I do not work for this company I am a real Amazon customer."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",Let’s start with the reason for my purchase. I needed something to hold my phone oh my Honda Ruckus so I could it as a speedometer and gps mount. This got great rating so let’s try it...  Add to card / amazon prime and bam ! 2 days later  This mounted well for the handle bars but the way it’s designed you can put it on a wide range of handle bae grips. There is a main side clip that holds quite well and the rubber backing that you slip over the corners locks it in. I took a drive and the wind didn’t even make it move. There are two larger rubber backs and a smaller one. Also comes with an extra thumb screw. If it can stay I. My moped it can stay on a bike. I’m actually going to try it on my bike (pedal) also. Great but and loook forward to using it a lot. As always I will update in the future to gauge the quality of this product.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机", This is amazing! Holds incredibly well! Here is a video of my husband doing 95 mph while the iphone 7+ is on the holder.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",Order was delivered on time and the phone mount worked great on my recumbent trike. I hit some big bumps but the mount held the phone steady. This mount is a great value for the price AND has great performance!
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",Bought this for my Harley softail custom. Worked ok for about two weeks before the ball and stem snapped off on the highway ruining my phone and costing me to replace it. Very unhappy
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",Well that lasted a week...... if you have a Harley I don't recommend it a lot of vibration this thing sticks out
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Had great expectations about this mount since, by some strange reason, has great reviews. Only lasted a couple of days! The main hold snapped out dropping my phone to the ground! After contacting the company explaining what happened and how my screen shattered in millions of pieces, the best they could do was to refund me for the faulty mount. They never even offered to replace my screen or phone. Very disappointing!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Product is great works very well until it broke( one of the arms came off the spring inside ) . Company claims lifetime warranty but that does not appear to be the case... I have been in contact with "" Bernadette "" who will email me back 1 to 2 days after I've emailed her at 1:00amCST IF I'm lucky and is not helpful. I followed all the instructions on the website and package as far as registering the warranty. they will reply until it't time to actually send the product out. WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN I'd rather pay a few more bucks and deal with someone who stands behind their warranty statement."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",Play Video  Very easy to install and to adjust for riders preferences. I am tall so I need to be able to adjust the angle of my phone differently than someone shorter than me. I like that I can move the phone to where I can see it. Depending on the day and direction I am riding the sun will hit the phone and makes it hard to see. With this mount I can adjust it on the fly in order to see the face of my phone. The holder fits my S9+ with the otter box on. I do have to install the straps in a kiddy corner pattern; one top corner and the opposite bottom corner then repeat. Alot easier than trying to put both top corners over the phone than the 2 bottom corners. Easy to remove and install the phone when I get on and off the bike at stops. It is very secure and does not bounce around. It also comes with a registered Lifetime warranty. I added a accessories bar because my bike has sloping handlebars that narrow as they slope. It lifted the phone holder out of the way of my other displays.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Just got this and was excited. Before install as I tried to clamp my phone, one of the springs on the clamp fell right off. Tried to reattach the spring to no avail.  Decided to continue since the silicon straps would be good enough. The tension knob to tighten the swivel ball couldn't be tightened enough to hold the unit at a specific angle (didn't try any tools at risk of breaking it). It was almost tight but not quite. Went out for a short ride to try it out, and the phone kept swiveling at different angles.  Very disappointed. I guess I got what I paid for. :("
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机"," I am happy with this purchase, I got this mount for my electric bike and took it for a ride. It seemed to hold up pretty well. The mount comes with two elastic replacements of different sizes, which comes in handy if you have different size phones. I use a pop-socket glued to my phone case so I found the elastic quite useful and made me feel safe that my phone was not going to go off flying while I am riding on bumpy roads. The mount uses a horizontally adjustable clamp that holds your phone and a silicone elastic band for double security. Consider buying this mount if you plan to have it permanently on your bike, not a good idea if you are planning to use the same mount for different bikes. I hope the video helps (product not sponsored) !!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",I attached this to my Triumph and when I came down the next day it was in pieces.  The reason is that I overtightened the clamp. The clamp is metal. The mount is brittle plastic. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what could happen.  I didn't lose a phone. Really just out $10. But I'd be furious if this happened on the riad
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",We bought two of these. One each for my wife and I. The price was right and I was planning on using it on a trainer only. Why? Well frankly I didn't trust the rubber bands to hold my phone in an active and windy world. I still haven't but my wife has. Her first time out this year she hit a sandy spot and went down. Her phone never left the mount and survived unscathed. I was mildly impressed as she and her bike were not so lucky. The bracket is made so that it will fit skinny or very fat handlebars. It holds the phone tight enough that I don't worry about the mount creeping and having to manually adjusted at some point during the ride.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I bought this for my Yamaha FZ-09. I read the reviews and it seemed awesome. I bought this bake in May and barely two months later of mild use it's entirely broken apart. Within the first two weeks of owning it, the rubber strap broke on it. I thought maybe it was defective, and I tried to use the other similar size strap and that one broke as well. Finally decided to use the larger of the provided straps and that one seemed okay, but it would have way more play and the straps would slowly move back as if it was going to drop the phone eventually at speed. So I downgraded to the smaller strap again and haven't had any issues until this morning. I went to go for my normal ride, got my phone out and pulled back the little plastic claps on either side and POP! The lower half broke off entirely. Looks like the spring inside broke as well. I probably used this thing maybe a total of 20-25 times in the past 2 months because I really only have it for GPS purposes. Anyways it's failed my test, and it's pretty unsafe to have for a phone in my opinion."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I contacted the supplier and explained that the mount didn't seem to fit my BMW F800GT handlebar. The supplier's response was prompt and hassle free. I tried both screws sent in the package and I still couldn't get it to fit. I was planning to return it today. Before returning it, I decided to get my husband to attempt the mounting on my motorcycle. Magic hands, I guess? For some reason, he attached the mount and phone without a problem. The fit is perfect. I test road the new device, cradling my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 phone. I rode over some rather bumpy inner city street. When I arrived at my destination an hour later, the phone and mount were solid and secure. I'm glad my search is over and I now don't need to return the mount.  UPDATE: June 26, 2018 I order this product on June 3, 2017--a little more than a year ago. Living in Chicago, I only get to ride my motorcycle about 8 months out of the year. I've used this mount technically speaking, less than one year. This week, the grip on one side of the spring loaded clip came off its track. I don't know where the spring is. I was able to put the grip back on its track but I now have to be extremely careful in loading and unloading the phone. I hav to take extra precaution to make sure I've securely situated the phone between the grips. It's quite annoying to do this each time! I still think the unit is a good idea but the grip, spring loading thingy should not have failed--especially in less than a year of use. This changes my five stars of a year ago, to 3 stars."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Lasted just 18 days before it broke. In that time probably lasted about 10 rides on my handle bars. I'm not a hardcore cyclist either, so the rides weren't tough. Item was not mishandled. Just popped a spring that I can't get back into place and ultimately lost the clamp that holds the phone and dropped my phone mid ride."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","This is my second phone mount that is engineered like this model. The rubber strap broke on my last one after long use. I prefer this model as opposed to others based on numerous features: it mounts to any size handle bars due to 2 types of adjustments on collar that goes onto handle bars, there are 3 different rubber ""mesh"" parts used to attach actual phone to your phone mount backing plate. I recommend keeping additional rubber mesh attachments so you have a back-up if and when the original breaks so you are not forced to buy an entire new system. My last one was still perfectly fine, but one of the rubber corners broke so my phone was not as secure as I would like so I bought this new mount system. It is sturdy plastic overall, the screw used to fasten and tighten down the clamp for the handle bars is secure and strong enough to torque down tightly enough for secure attachment to handle bars themselves. I have tried other configurations of phone mounts, but I prefer this system. I have a heavy duty phone mount for my road bike that uses screws to tighten phone down to backing plate, but ironically, the screws come loose during a ride and I have dropped my phone 3 times due to screws coming lose during ride. This specific system uses the rubber ""mesh"" to keep the phone in place to the backing plate and it never comes loose as a byproduct of the rubber ""mesh"" piece. Hence; this is why I prefer this mounting system."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","True story. Two weeks after a medical emergency I decided it was time to get back on my bike. Mounted my phone on my new holder, grabbed helmet and water bottle and took off. Played some hard rock and rap (yes, 58-year old women listen to rap sometimes) to keep my energy up. Almost at the end of my ride, I took a break. I grabbed onto my phone and started removing corner holders. Next thing I know, I hear, “911, what’s your location.” I think it’s the beginning of one of my rap songs. Then I hear it again, “911, what’s the location of your emergency.” Realizing none of my songs say that twice. I say, confused, “Hello?” She tells me my phone dialed 911 and asks if I’m okay. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry,” I said, “I’m fine. I don’t know how that happened. I’m so sorry!” She says it’s not a problem, and hangs up. I’m in a panic. What did I do? How did that happen? More importantly, will I do it again?! In the midst of my panic, my phone rings. It’s my husband. Freaking out, he asks, “ARE YOU OKAY?” I stutter, “yeah, fine, I’m - “ and I hit the end button by mistake. Crap. I try calling him, he tries calling me, busy signals, finally we talk again. I assure him I’m fine. Turns out, which I didn’t know, if you hold down the power button and one of the volume buttons for a long time, your iPhone automatically calls 911. And alerts my emergency contact that I’ve called 911. Oh boy. It took my husband hours to get his heart rate back to normal. Oh, and don’t ask me WHICH volume button because I’m not doing it again just to find out. So. Good to know. Please note this has no bearing on the phone holder. Phone holder works great. But when you are taking off the elastic corners, PLEASE WATCH YOUR HAND PLACEMENT. Do NOT press side buttons of phone while taking corners off. 😉"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","The mount works perfectly! It fit right into my little Puch SportMaxi moped with no issues. But please be aware: the constant shaking involved with a phone being mounted on a bike can eventually damage your phone’s camera. The vibrations damage the gyroscope for the OIS, as well as the auto-focus feature. My back camera on my old iPhone stopped working correctly after only three months of inconsistent riding. The camera can’t focus and it buzzes and vibrates if you try to use it. I ended up buying a new phone because the camera replacement was so expensive. So please be mindful of that when you are mounting your phone on any type of bike. Check your phone manufacturer’s advice. I checked after the fact and saw that Apple strongly discourages mounting their phones on big engine bikes; and gently discourages mounting them onto mopeds and scooters. And now I’ve spoke my piece, so do what you want with that information. Ride safe and take care!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",This product was recommended by Amazon. I haven’t seen one I like for any reasonable price. I saw that this has the “C” style clamp to grab the sides. Many have that. But this also has a rubber rectangle that holds all four corners. So you don’t have to worry about it sliding out. So clamp holds steady from vibrations and rubber keeps it from sliding out. It is excellent quality. And there may be a better holder but I cannot afford to buy a bunch of phones and I trust this holder 100%. Under $20 including shipping is why I decided to jump on it. I figured if it aucked I wouldn’t be out much. Well I love it. I ordered another one yesterday to give to my buddy for his birthday. I have an iPhone 6S plus. So it is very large if you’re not familiar. But this has it covered. There are 4 different sized rubber mats to hold phone. You just check which one fits you best and slide it on for installation. Super easy to figure out. Super easy to use. Let’s me keep my phone on handlebars vs pocket so I can change mp3 and also keep my google maps open. If I lose this somehow I will definitely buy another one. Highly recommend.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I've been using this mount for a while, and it works just great. I haven't lost confidence in its mounting stability, or phone retention while riding up and down the road. Mounts to a single bar using a wing nut and clamp system and a rubber grip to keep it positioned on my bars. I've only had to tighten it once just for safety. The phone retention has 2 spring loaded side grips, plus a rubber ""web"" to grab the corners of the phone, seems like a failsafe method of keeping your phone in place. I particularly like this because I don't need a super special phone case to mount it securely. I can leave my case on and secure it.  The only negative I can give it is sometimes when loading the phone into the spring-loaded side grips, it'll mash my volume down button, but once it is in correctly, it doesn't force the volume all the way down. Theres just enough clearance for the side buttons when properly in place. I'd rather have my expensive phone secured and deal with the mounting annoyance sometimes than have to get a new phone. This is a good mount!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I purchased this for my Ninebot E22 E-Kickscooter. It's a tight fit on the left handlebar, but with some adjustment, works perfect. I tried to mount on the right handlebar, but it prevented the ""throttle"" control from bouncing back after releasing my thumb.  I'm also using this with a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, and it definitely holds it well! So for the few of you looking for a good mount for a foldable phone and kick scooter, with some adjustment, this works very well. If the handlebar grips were just a little less wide, it would be a very easy fit for Ninebot E-kickscooters."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I bought this to hold my rather large phone so that I can ride my bike with both hands on the handlebars. Seriously tho, I needed a way to mount my rather large phone to the handlebars on my bike. And I wanted one that would fit different size bars so that my wife can use it on her bike as well. We'll work out the sharing details later.  I found this item to fit a range of handlebars without issue and definitely holds my large and heavy (with the case) phone very securely on a range of terrain. It comes with different size silicone nets to wrap around the edges of the phone to hold it tight. So I can easily swap between my Galaxy and my wife's much smaller phone. I'll probably have to buy another for my wife's bike..."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I bought this six months ago and waited until now to provide a review because, well, you just want to make sure it works after you put it through the motionsj I bought this six months ago and waited until now to provide a review because, well, you just want to make sure it works after you put it through the motions. And, what can I say… This cell phone mount just works. It works when only 2 of the 4 straps are secured, it works even when you’ve improperly installed the phone altogether.  There were several times where I was in so much of a hurry to get on the bike and just ride that I actually forgot to secure the corner straps and literally did not notice until after the ride. The phone did not budge the entire time.  More reasons it’s worth the buy: recently I took a small spill due to a patch of deep, loose gravel and even with the bike head over my heels, my phone sustained no damage at all because it was still securely fastened to the bike handlebars. I also can’t say how many times I have accidentally kneed the phone/mount while pedaling aggressively (even knocked it loose of the clasp) and still, the phone never wound up on the ground.  The plastic construction may offer some doubt as to the integrity of its holding capacity, but it has not failed me yet.  To answer some of the reviews of the clasp failing, I can only say that if you over-torque the nut, then that is something that is likely to happen because it is in-fact plastic. But over toward he is not necessary unless you quite literally throw your bike off of a cliff or get into a head on collision with something very heavy and very stationary."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Premium? The bracket sheared at the ball joint while I was riding down the highway on my motorcycle. My phone is now destroyed. I do not recommend buying this bracket if you plan on keeping your phone in one piece. I had to buy a new phone.  Update: To be fair, I was reimbursed for the purchase. Unfortunately, I still had to buy a new phone."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I’m rating the product a 3 but the company service is a 10, at least. Read on to find out why. I bought this to use on my Harley to hold my phone while using Google Maps and for listening to tunes via my bike’s Bluetooth. It was very simple to install on my 1”1/4” handlebars. Took maybe 3 minutes to get it clampled down and adjusted. Will fit any size bars due to the adjustability of the mounting clamp. The clamp is plastic however and the adjusting bolt that joins the clamp halves is extremely long to allow figment to variable diameter bars. Even on my thick bars there was way more bolt than I needed so it hung out long past the clamp threads. The thumb screw on the bolt is also plastic and I question the long term durability given exposure to temps and UV rays. The holder performed beyond my expectations on my Ozark Mountain trip. I never was concerned about the integrity of the holder. The “butterfly” elastic wings in combination with the spring loaded phone clamp securely held my cell steady even on rough roads. After the trip I put the holder away and didn’t get it out until I was going to use it on a recent Florida trip. When I mounted the phone holder I noticed that one side of the spring loaded clamp was missing. I looked where I had stored the holder when it was off the bike but could not locate this critical piece. Not really sure how that piece could have fallen off as it is connected internally with a spring that allows it to move and adjust to the width of your phone. Without both sides of the spring loaded clamp I would not trust the holding capabilities of the device. Here’s where the story gets good. Even though I bought this in August of 2018 and the piece went missing in March 2019 I emailed the company to to see if they could send a replacement clamp half. I promptly received a response asking for a picture of the defective holder, which I sent. The next day they advised that they would be sending a complete new holder free of charge. Two days later it arrived in the mail. This type of customer care is rare today. They were easy to deal with, communicated amazingly and seemed genuinely interested in making my buying experience memorable. The product is fine (it’s only $13) as long as the spring loaded cell clamp stays together. But if it doesn’t, this company will stand behind their product. Buy with confidence."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","UPDATE 9/12/21 See photo. Unit snapped while riding - dropping my phone to the street - while still attached to the holder. Now, this is mounted on my mount bike which sees a lot of bouncing and hard hitting. It has actually held up quite well under what I would call ""heavy duty"" usage. Would I buy it again, yes, as I know the company stands behind its product - read below.  Holds my Samsung S5 Active (heavy/large) very well. My phone has never fallen out of the mount. It's a little awkward getting the phone into the mount, but again, it's never fallen out - even in rough terrain. I purchased this Roam product three years ago and recently purchased another one for my wife's bike.  Customer support - I had to reposition the mount when I added a bell. I accidentally overtightened the mounting screw and broke the mount. I emailed roam and explained what happened. I asked if they could replace the broken part. They said they would send me an entire brand new mount. Within a week I had my new mount!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Bought this after reading some good reviews on cycling & tech sites. So far so good. Pretty basic and easy set up, 3 slots for the handlebar clip adjusts to most handle bar widths. My handlebars are 'tapered' (thick by by neck, thinner by grips) and the padding on this phone mount is thick enough that even clamped on the angle part of the handlebars there is a good grip. The mount itself seems solid so far, 2 spring loaded grips holds the phone in place in the middle and then the webbed rubber corner tabs stretch to secure the phone well while allowing some vertical adjustment to avoid buttons. Also the ball socket adds ability to rotate phone either vertical or horizontal as well as up/down/left/right. Also also came with 2 extra replacement rubber webbings and a replacement screw that closes the clamp to the handlebars.  So far so good. Seems solid and affordable. Even held phone secure when I unfortunately slipped and dumped the bike pretty hard."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","My recent purchase of the phone mount was a result of riding my motorcycle on roads that are very unfamiliar and windy causing a bit of disorientation. I needed a handlebar mounted phone cradle and chose this one. It's quite easy to install, comes with two additional rubber retainers of two sizes, and includes a swivel mount similar to windshield mounted car phone cradles. I've no reservations with the mount whatsoever. I will say that my phone, a Galaxy A51 and the phone case I use doesn't work as well as I'd like with the mount but it is due to the placement of the on/off switch on the phone and I'm using a case with a magnetic mount. Regardless, the rubber retainer keeps all in place. I'd buy it again and probably will should the need arise."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I have a pop socket on my phone that I use every day, so my options were to find an open-backed phone mount or modify a rigid mount. I found an open-backed mount.  I don't ride trails or BMX, but I commute and ride suburbs and this mount holds my phone with zero problems. It has a rigid frame retention clamp that spreads from the middle to grab your phone by the size and then employs a four-cornered stretch band system to secure it vertically (it has the original band plus two replacements, so don't sweat breaking it) and does a good job of both. The mounting system is simple, but I wouldn't call it versatile--it'll mount to handle bars and not much else, though it does give you a lot of play with regard to size.  It's rubberized in all the key securing points, so it handles vibration (at least on bicycle scale) very well.  The ball socket gives you plenty of freedom to orient your phone however you please.  I don't know if it'd be my first choice if I didn't have to account for the pop socket on my phone but it meets my needs and performers very well at a good price. I have my doubts it'd retain my phone if I took a spill, but that's what I have a phone case for."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","There were some negative reviews about the ease of assembly. I found it totally intuitive and it might have taken 2 minutes. There are four instructions on the side of the package. There are three size allowances for the handlebar thickness. I chose the third but after two rides I may select a thinner diameter because of the foam tape wrapping my handlebar. One may question the longevity of the rubber security band that attaches to each corner of the phone, but two additional replacements came in the box. I suspect you could get more from the company if needed but rubber bands would also work. There is an additional long thumb screw in the box to secure the appliance around the handlebar. It's a well thought out engineered product with a good price. I have another holder made by a different company that's about four years old on my other bike that has held up and some parts failed but the phone still holds."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I have been using the ROAM phone mount on my adult Sun Trike for over a week now and am very pleased with it. First off, right out of the box there were two extra silicone nets and one extra handlebar screw provided, which I thought was very useful to have as a back up. Also included within the box is a small card with directions to use the website to register the mount for a lifetime warranty, along with a 40% off coupon on another ROAM purchase. The mount itself is very well made and of good quality material. Next, there are clearly understandable installation instructions printed right on the side of the box - truthfully, it is so simple to install I really didn't even need the instructions. Getting the phone into the mount is very easy and it is held in place very securely with the silicone nets. While riding, the phone is held in place very steadily and I am so happy to have my phone conveniently available during my rides. I will mention that my rides consist of some side streets, sidewalks, and paved trails. Even though there are some rough spots that are a bit jarring I do not experience the kind of vibration that is typical of motorcycles or bikes used on very rough terrain, so I cannot speak with any certainty how this mount will work on those scenarios. For my use, this mount is absolutely perfect and I highly recommend it for the more casual rider. I will update further in the future to report on long term use, but for now, I am completely happy with the performance and price of this phone mount."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",I've been looking for something to hold my phone when I'm using my scooter through New York. I was worried it wouldn't fit the handlebars of my scooter as they are pretty thick but thankfully the holder has several widths it can go to and it comes with a longer screw as well.  Obviously my phone isn't in the photo but I have a Google Pixel 4A and it fits perfectly with the larger rubber sling. It's very secure when locked into place and doesn't move around even with driving over bumps. My scooter only goes up to 15 miles per hour so it doesn't budge at all.

But, I was riding my bike yesterday and completely ate it and after the initial shock of the fall I looked to see that my phone was still in the holder as if nothing happened. I said right then and there 5 stars! I jacked up my ankle, but my phone was completely secured! I also love the rotating ability of the holder to put it in any angle I want. You can lock the position by tightening the little plastic piece below the part that it rotates. I can take video of the bike path, see what route I’m taking, change music, etc. Would buy again! I’ll come back after some time has passed to see it’s longevity. For now, I will be icing and resting my injury.."

However, he was thrilled to get it. He bought a used motorized bike (I didn't know they even made these) and as I was looking for a few items he needed I came across this Room co-pilot, universal bike mount for smart phones. I read about it and thought, what a great idea. I did look at some others, but I kept going back to this one. I do read reviews and I believe it had over 9,000.00 (at that time) and all of those I read, and I read quite a few, were lower than 4 stars. It was a win, win, great reviews and the price was ever better. I will come back and give an update when he gets a chance to use it. We have snow where we live so it will be a few months before I'll be able to give you an update. I was excited that I came across it. I hope everyone that reads this has a very Happy New year and stay safe. Thank you Roam for making a great product, it added to our very merry Christmas and the perfect gift for my husband. I'll be looking for more products made by you. Much Respect, Dianne"

His speedometer went out on his (motorcycle-sized) scooter, so he was never sure if he was speeding, or going too slow. A friend told him about a speedometer app, & showed him some mounts for motorcycles. I purchased the Co-Pilot for him. Scooters have different handle bars than motorcycles, so it didn't fit. I got creative, & put it on the mirror bracket. It was easy for him to install, after I did a trial fit, & he loves having it where he can easily see his phone. The only downside is that it's made for thicker bars, so it's not as tight as we'd like. One big bump, & it will flop down, but it's easy to fix. Would be better with a thicker piece of rubber. We can add something, but since he parks at a park & ride when he takes public transportation, we didn't want him dropping the added piece when he removes the holder to take with him."

I have a pony cart I attached my phone holder too. We cover a lot of rough ground sometimes. And I use an app to measure our route, distance and speed. I don’t have to take the phone out of the carrier to monitor our drive. I have a dinosaur 6 plus IPhone. I love this holder."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Update: I used this for several weeks and the base that attaches to the handlebars broke. I contacted the company to see if I could get a replacement for that piece and they sent me a whole new unit. I couldn’t be happier with their product and their excellent customer service!  This is a great phone mount at a good price! I use this on my Harley-Davidson Sportster 883 with an app that lets me plan out scenic routes to ride. This means I need the phone in a place where I can easily see it and it needs to be stable. I looked at a BUNCH of different phone mounts before finally deciding on this one, and I’m glad I did. It fits my iPhone 8 Plus and secures it well. It stays exactly where I need it and performs admirably. It comes with two extra silicone bands to increase the longevity of the product, though they seem of such high quality that it will be a long time before the original one will need to be replaced. If you’re looking for a phone mount for a similar purpose, look no further because you won’t find anything better at this price."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I was a little concerned initially that the silicone straps were long enough to secure my phone (Google Pixel 3A in an Otterbox case) but they did just fine. They had to stretch out just a little, and by the second use; they were great. The initial bit of stretching has not continued, IE; the straps didn't stretch out until they became loose; they are still very tight and secure, but I don't have the feeling that I'm going to tear them when I secure my phone in place. The phone mount came with two spare silicone straps so even if the first one does eventually tear, it looks like I'll be fine for a long time. The mounting system to the bike is fine and seems to be working well. I've had my mountain bike up and down some very rocky trails, bouncing around pretty hard, and the mounting system is holding things just fine. Sometimes the phone will droop left to or right a bit, but that may be something I can correct by looking closer at the back of the mount to see if there's something to tighten up. I haven't bothered yet because the occasional slight droop is corrected on the fly, easily enough. So far, I'm very happy with this mounting system and I would recommend it to my friends."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I’ve rode just over 2,000 miles this year, had this since Mile 1. I use my old iPhone 5 as a” dashboard” for my Wahoo sensors and for music. Mounted on the stem. Through literally dozens of rides the stretchable part at the corners has held the device tightly without any stretching that I can see. The side bracket is also in great shape. I check it maybe every 500 miles since it’s been so solid and it barely needs any tightening. I cannot comment as to how it fares while mountain biking or riding on crushed stone gravel bike paths, but I think it would likely be fine - it may just need to be tightened a bit more often.  I like it so much that I purchased a second one to put on the bike I permanently have mounted to my smart trainer. Highly recommended."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",This is my second purchase of this mount. I really like the way it works on my mountain bike so I bought a second one for my road bike. The mounting system is very flexible and fits both bikes nicely. It seems secure and solid.  The only issue I have is that I unlock my phone with the fingerprint reader on the back of my phone (Samsung Galaxy 9) and that is very hard (but not impossible) to reach when the phone is mounted.  If I had a 3rd bike I'd buy a third mount.

This handled exceptionally well. I added my GoPro to the bike as well, it seems the go pro moved much more than this stand. I hit the trails and this stand handled amazingly. My phone did not move at all from it's place. This was easy to add and remove the phone from here, with the elastic bands that hold it in place. The trails were intermediate trails, had a lot of hills and bumps, like I said, my go pro moved more than the phone. I highly recommend this bike mount. It even comes with. extra straps should you want to switch them out."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","12 July 2020 - Review update - As noted in my prior posts, I have purchased two Roam Co-Pilots, one for my bike, one for my girls bike. We have done a lot of riding the past several months. Most recently, we did a lot of riding in the Berkshire region of Massachusetts. The product held up extremely well. There were no issues of the product not holding the phones. There were no issues of the phones vibrating. We did riding on major highways as well as surface roads (back roads). No issues noticed. Very good product for the price. This will be my last post regarding this product unless for some strange reason it fails within the coming year, which I highly doubt it will. Cheers!  28 May 2020 - Review update - As promised, spring arrived here in New England and I have had several opportunities to get out on the bike and test the Roam. So far it has performed flawlessly. The slight movement I was anticipating has not happened. The phone stays in one position. It is a nice addition to have the GPS available while riding.  Also, I did purchase a second one for my girls bike (2015 Honda Rebel) and mounted the Roam on her bike just last week. She went on a long ride to Cape Cod and said the Roam was absolutely a plus. She was able to use the GPS function without any issues. The handlebars on the Rebel do not leave too much room to mount the Roam, but I was able to find a spot on the left handle bar that made it easy to view and use.  Overall, both of us are very satisfied with this product. If anyone has any doubts, put those fears to rest, I will recommend this product each time the topic comes up. And because I have now 'road' tested the product, I would like to update the overall rating to five stars. Stay safe out there.  December 2019 - Purchased this product as a Christmas gift to myself. Was looking for something dependable, yet reasonably priced. Easy to put together out of the box and came with three (3) silicone nets. The Roam is mounted on my 2012 Honda Shadow Phantom. However, weather here in the northeast is not conducive to riding a motorcycle right now. So, any true product review will have to wait until spring 2020 which is why I gave it four stars overall.  I did notice one feature that I am not sure how it will effect operation. With the holder mounted on the handlebars, fully tightened, I can still move the 360 degree ball socket with my hands. Not sure how that will hold up traveling on the road. I envision that the phone will move a bit, requiring slight adjustments while riding. My potential fix for this is to glue a small (very small) piece of thin rubber (like a piece of a rubber band) to the tip of the ball (pivot point). My hope is the rubber will keep the phone from moving at all. Also, in order to move the phone to a different position, my hope is it will require the mechanism to be loosened quite a bit in order to break free of the rubber band friction. When the good weather arrives in 2020, I will test my theory and update the review.  Oh, one more thing. I will be purchasing a second Roam Co-Pilot this week for my girls bike (2015 Honda Rebel). I am doing so because so far, based on what I have seen, I am confident that the Roam Co-Pilot will function flawlessly. It appears to be very well built of a hard plastic, has 360 degree maneuverability, and is reasonably priced.  Stay tuned for an update in spring 2020."

Though their bike baskets work reasonably well for transporting basic gear such as a jacket or water bottle, the need to protect their phone for the “commute” has always been an issue. The ride always included lots of bumps over uneven areas and even items in the basket need securing to prevent being jostled out. Placing in a pocket or holding in their hand just doesn’t seem like the best way to go considering how expensive phones are these days. We researched and purchased one Roam mount and were very pleased with ease of installation, use, accessibility and most importantly, security of the phone. All great! And so we purchased a second. Five stars. Highly recommend!"

"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I bought this for the 2003 Heritage for my unexpected road trip from PA to TN (500 miles one way) to ride the Tail of the Dragon. I went back and forth between Quad Lock and Rokform, but in the end I went with the cheap option. I was very pleased with how it held up on the highways (behind the windshield). The mount never budged even when hitting some bumps going 70 mph. If I planning on using this more often, I might have considered a Quad Lock more, but for casual use maybe 4 or 5 times a year this is perfect. The only issue that I have, and it cant be helped due to the design and mount of the phone, is the rubber straps that cover corners on the phone. I used gloves with touch sensitivity and it was difficult to peek behind to corners to see the battery life, notifications, and hit the back button on my phone. None of those are deal breakers, but took some practice while driving to make any adjustments I needed."

The unit mounts easily to the bicycle handle bars and securely holds the phone using a spring clamp, and silicone rubber corner straps. On my Android phone, the power button is mounted on the side, so the phone has to be clamped slightly off-center vertically. My friend's I-phone mounted perfectly centered. I don't use the phone while riding, but have found that the phone is more secure on my handlebars than in my pants pocket where it could fall out. Phone is very easily removed when finished riding."

I use them on both motorcycles and a mountain bicycle. The bicycle only sees greenways these days, nothing technical.  I've covered over 39,000 miles on motorcycles using this mount. The only thing I would change is the attachment systems for the clamp often has me worried about the long screw that is used to attach it. It limits where you can place the clamp on handlebars - I'm on my 4th motorcycle using this mounting system.  I also wish you could find a rugged extension to get the phone holder part of the mount raised up and off the surface of the handlebars.  Small gripes, but the mount works very well. I've never worried about my phone flying off the mount at (insert proper speed limit here). ;)"

I have no unusual vibration or bouncing even well over 130mph+ (209kph+) So yeah, it seriously holds tight against the wind! Very glad I purchased this over the $100++ expensive phone mount. UPDATED: The rubber phone grip was wearing out after10 months of HARD use; was mostly due to stretching over the huge Otterbox phone case and the Florida sun. I just bought another, and I am happy to report, they have improved it. The new rubber phone grip is tough and thick. I love fact that it takes some muscle to hook it on the edges of my phone now.

Only drawback was it what is the rainy season in Indonesia in the metal screw head become Rusty in the weather ... not a big deal but maybe they can make it out of a different material so that doesn’t happen in the future.

"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I mounted this on my stock motorcycle handlebars right in front of me. The clamp that adjusts to your bar needs has 3 adjustments available. For my bars it is adjusted perfectly in the middle adjuster slot. Very easy to mount (and instructions are super clear).  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime and I have a pretty snug case on it. It barely fits in the phone holder - but it does. My phone & case measure 3.25"" side to side and 6"" top to bottom.  It comes with 3 different sized ""webs"" and the largest fits mine perfectly. Once I pulled each of the corners over the phone, it holds it VERY snugly. The phone holder has a pivot ball so you can adjust your phone pretty much any way you want to.  I can't yet speak to durability as I've not ridden with it. It appears to be made of durable plastic and since I will only use it when I take long rides (to have a maps app going on my phone) it should last a long while.  A great idea and great value! Yes I actually bought this and did not receive it as a free promotional of any kind. P.S. A few days later: While my phone just did not quite fit - I discovered my Garmin GPS - does! It measures 3 x 5. I've included a picture. And the safety ""web"" is nice and snug!"

Also they include two different sizes of the rubber webbing for different applications. They also included an extra webbing in the more popular larger size. I will be testing this tethered and suggest others do the same. I mounted my first purchase to the center of the handlebars between the mounts to reduce vibration. In the event of a failure I will update this review, no update, no problems. My adult son, as soon as he laid eye's on the one I got, checked it over and immediately said, ""I want one, this thing looks great!"", he has since bought his own and loves it!

The phone is secured by the rubber, which folds over the four corners, and secured by the hard plastic piece on the side. Never had the phone fall out, or the phone move up and down when riding. Best phone mount I have seen, would work on just about any application that has a bar. There is a plastic screw on the piece that holds the phone; tighten this when you get the phone into the desired position, and then it will not move. For this price, you can not get a better working phone mount. If you buy this product, you will not be disappointed."

Great customer service!  Now for the review: Just returned form a off road trip where we covered over 250 miles of trails, many rated as black diamond (difficult/extreme). We used a map application so having the phone viewable to navigate the trails was very useful. My phone is large and has a heavy case so I was concerned that the mount would not be sturdy enough; it was never a problem and was as sturdy on the last mile as it was in the beginning (never had to adjust or tighten it). We mounted it to the passenger fear bar and it stayed perfectly in place for the entire trip.  I don't do many reviews but with a combination of a great product and a great customer service I wanted to let people know that they will not go wrong choosing this mounting system. There are a bunch of different mounts on Amazon and we sort of just guessed when we ordered this one but in the end we couldn't be happier with the choice!  Anyway, just wanted to let people know that both the product and service are great!"

The 45-minute workout keeps our septuagenarian bodies in great shape, and having the Roam Universal Bike Phone Mount keeps the phone secure, steady, and readily available. Beats carrying it in my pocket or having to wear a shirt with a pocket all the time.  Super design, great shipping service, outstanding value. I'm buying another for my other...guess that says it all."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Bought enough of these to know how they can suck from one aspect or another, clamp hold, wobbly play, tightening features, parts that wear easily. This may be an exception. Component feels strong through out all parts. Clamp is strong, phone holder is strong, stabilizer is strong, rubber holder feels solid, and it came w 3 extra. Knob and bolt seem small, but I can see where it’s easily replaced, and it. Am w an extra bolt. Overall, very satisfied with what I see. The real test will be at 75mph or higher. Previous mounts have all failed some aspect of the windy ride. Will update."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","For the price it is much better than I thought it would be. It holds the phone very well, comes with 3 different sizes of bands to fit any phone, 2 screws for many different bar attachment size/locations, and what appears to be an awesome warranty. I cannot speak to the actual warranty procedure as I have not used it but it is a limited lifetime, no questions asked process that you register by only inputting your email. Takes 10 seconds and looks legit. Everything about this product has been quick and easy. Thank you!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Let me first say that I am not using this phone mount on a bike, motocycle, or any other form or transportation. I am using it to mount an iPhone on a camera gimbal arm so I can easily use the phone as a wifi connected monitor and controller while shooting video with a mirrorless camera. The product description said it was universal and I assume it is since it fits the gimbal arm perfectly and has plenty of adjustment for other uses. It is very adjustable and holds my iPhone much steadier that solutions designed for my specific need have been. The materials for the basic holder and the rubber pieces that hold the phone by the corners seem to be high quality and strong. I have used the mount with both an iPhone 6 Plus and an iPhone X and in both cases tested each with and without a phone case. It all worked. My application is likely not as rough on the mount and phone as bike and motocycle riding could be, but this product certainly addresses the need to mount an iPhone for video support."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I've had this mount for a year now. I wasn't sure how long it would last, but so far I am impressed. The rubber harness and plastic grips are pretty tight and hold the phone really well. The swivel is also stays very tight, so the phone doesn't swing loosely from side to side and stays in the same position the entire. The grips are gentle and don't damage handlebar chrome. It's not a fancy looking grip, but it does what it's supposed to very well."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","This item works as advertised. So easy to mount. Mounting capability is super flexible and should fit on any handlebar size. I appreciate that it included several extra rubber mounting templates that will handle various size devices.....and that can be used as extras. Mount is strong and centered, insuring that the phone stays in position even over bumps.......as it can be mounted in a centered position. Also, it has full pivot capabilities, so you can face your phone at any angle that you want and still have it stay in place. Highly recommend."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I first bought this for use on a Vespa, but the way the mounting device works it didn’t fit on the handlebars and took up too much room. I now use it on my bicycle and it fits much better. It’s scary to use at first but it’s been very secure even on New York City street bumps. Overall I would recommend this product for anyone looking to secure their phone to a bicycle, but be careful if you’re looking to buy for a scooter or a motorcycle."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I have two of the phone holders. It’s a bit difficult to install at first but once you figure out it’s easy. I like that it can be adjusted up, down or sideways, unlike other that I had to return.  Like very much the quality and the simplicity of the design. I made a mistake of not installing the straps properly and my phone fell while riding through cobblestone on my scooter. I readjusted the straps and made sure they were pulled correctly and no issues after that. Will recommend."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I have to say this thing really knows how to hold a phone. I bought this for my dirt bike so I could easily look at the trail maps on an old cell phone and I've crashed probably eight or nine times. The phone stayed put every time. When the battery on my old cell phone died I even felt confident enough in the mount to use my actual cell phone. Both phones are pixels the old phone is a Pixel 2 and the new one is a Pixel 3. My only real complaint was trying to get the amount attached to my dirt bike, the far I attached it to was thinner than I think the mount it's usually used for and there's a lot of cables and what not so mounting was a little difficult but that's hardly the mounts fault. Would buy again would even trust it on a dirt bike with a real cell phone."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",Bought this a few weeks ago and mounted it to my Honda Ruckus. Out for a ride today (2/21/21) and hit some loose gravel. Down went the Ruckus and me and after a short slide along the road I (dressed appropriately) was able to get up and walk back to my Ruckus. The new side pegs I also installed saved all but the left side mirror. The mount was still there firmly holding my phone in place. I don't think it moved at all. Was still in the exact position I left it. Not exactly a high speed crash but it did exactly what it was supposed to do.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Quick/accurate delivery. Easy setup. Extra parts included! (2 straps and 1 thumbscrew). These are the exact parts that would likely be the first to wear out in a year or so (maybe quicker here in 130 degree F maximum Yuma, Arizona) and in the case of the thumbscrew possible lost in the future if it rumbles itself free on my hog. VERY nice touch. In addition, I removed the other phone bike mount I just recently installed because it's an enclosed type and not only makes it difficult to see the screen while riding by also overheated the phone (which then goes into shutdown mode and, Murphys Law, it's right as I needed it most; last few turns as I approach a destination I've never been to). BTW I'm a BSEE from SJSU and I give this my ""Engineers stamp of approval"", if you will! (BTW) I despise bad Engineering and LOVE Great Engineering!!) :D  Shiny Side Up, EVERYONE! H Halseth."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","So far so great! I am happy with this mount so far. I have been using it off and on for a couple months now on my bicycle. I dont own a motorcycle so this review is for just a regular bicycle. Mountain bike to be exact and have to say it holds sturdy so far. The rubber deals on the sides are what hold it securely to the mount itself. The pieces in the center have rubber grips and are mostly just to keep your phone in one place. I have hit a few bumps and dips on the road and have not had it fall, twist or turn out of position on me. Even holds to the handle bars securely! And for those curious, I use a LG G5 phone with this"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",This is very easy to install and use. I have a Galaxy Note 10+ and it holds it just fine. There are a few different sizes of rubber that add reinforced security to whatever size phone you have. So it's a double layer of protection. Just make sure you tighten the screw well because it will (depending on the size and weight of your phone) tend to move when you are traversing rough terrain if you don't. Excellent product!
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","It’s lightweight which worried me at first, but the straps are really sturdy. I also liked the flexibility of its mounting on my handlebar (motorcycle) and the flexibility of the 360 pivot swivel. Depending on where you mount it and what you ride, there may be debris hitting the back of your phone (I commute on freeway and my bike is naked), but I did not experience any problems. I also had a huge iPhone, which made it seem to stretch the flexibility limits of the straps, but again, never was I disappointed and they held pretty great. I had the first one for over a year and the only thing that broke was the little bar that latches and locks behind the handlebar, but I’ll attribute that to user error as I possibly over tighten it. I did not remember that it has lifetime warranty but for the price I just went ahead and purchased a new one."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I use this to view my phone GPS and speed on a motorized bicycle and my phone doesn’t even give me the slightest hint that it’s ending up anywhere but in this mount until I went to remove it. My only con is that with bigger phones my like my iPhone 12 Pro Max, it can be kind of a drag to have to apply so much force to open up the harness enough to get it to fit around the phone. It’s a minor issue thought. The bands are an awesome idea and they give me the utmost confidence that even in a crash, my phone would probably remain on my handlebars."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I have two of these, one on the outdoor mountain bike and one on the indoor spinner. First, I'm a big fan of the rubber band type mounts because they are by far the most secure for outdoor riding. I am now a bigger fan of this particular one since it comes with two bands for different size phones or GPS. Thanks to the two bands provided, this mount on my Specialized Rockhopper now fits both my Iphone X Max and Garmin Oregon. I leave the extra band hanging loose right on the mount. The other mount I have on the indoor spinner which allows me to operate the phone fully while spinning away and watching TV or reading. Also fits my Kindle paperwhite by the way with a little effort on stretching the larger band. the bands are very good quality and feel secure and the versatility of the mount allows for any viewing mounting angle. Great product at a great price."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I love this phone mount! I was concerned that it wouldn’t fit on my ebike handle bars because there are so many gadgets already on it, but it fits in perfectly. The phone actually sits higher than all the other accessories (odo, light switch, speed assist display, breaks, etc) which makes it easier to mount. Awesome product! Now I want to try the light!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","This Roam Universal Motorcycle Phone Mount is THE BESTEST THING EVER! It's always been a challenge to stay off highways and roam the nice back roads to get to destinations while riding a bike. This is the answer to my prayers for sure! I used it a few weeks ago on a 4 hour road trip I took and it worked great! Easy to use; easy to see; I could even hear my phone navigating while riding, without earbuds. I used to have to write directions down on a little piece of paper and keep them in my pocket, usually pulling over after 4 or 5 maneuvers to read the next few I needed to take. It is super versatile and should fit on just about any handlebars, and the phone holder is also versatile and should hold pretty much any smart phone or navigation device you'd want to put in it. I highly recommend! And it got to me as promised, hours before I left on my trip so seller did a great job with that."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I mounted it on my side by side passenger grab bar. I do a lot of rough trail riding, ROUGH. I decided to give this mount a try. I install my Note 10 plus into the adapter just as recommended, BUT i also have taken 2 heavy duty rubber bands and wrapped them around at the top and bottom just for additional security. I then cover with a plastic bag to keep all the mud and dust to a minimum. I have not found any slippage or movement at all. Why did i wait so long to try this."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I truly can't fathom how the rating can be so high for this mount. The entire thing is cheap, brittle plastic and it WILL eventually crack,100% guaranteed. If you jolt this mount by just riding your bike normally, your phone will eventually go crashing to the ground (to which I can attest).  There's an all aluminum version from a competitor which is exponentially better. Skip this item and save your phone screen..."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",I order a ton of stuff from Amazon and almost never leave reviews. I had to leave one for this. The silicone sleeve to hold the phone is rock solid. The first thing I did was strap my phone into the mount and shook it around hard and had no movement. My 77 yamaha vibrates the bars quite a bit and I have no windscreen and this holds. I would use some removable thread lock on the thumb turn bolt thats the only part I could see failing. Your phone is not going anywhere with this.  I have a galaxy a51 with a slim case and easily fits.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",I have had this for about a year now. I have not had any issues with the holder. Sometimes putting my phone in the strap is a bit tricky as I have a larger Kyocera phone but it works great once I have it in the holder. I am able to position my phone so I can easily see my ride information. Mounting was not difficult and once it was mounted I have not had to readjust its position. I ride mainly on roads and trails that are pretty smooth. I would recommend this holder to any person looking for such a product.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",Bought this phone mount for my road bike. I made sure to do some research on different phone mounts and every website I looked at the Roam universal mount came in best overall. The Roam universal bike mount is great. I’ve had it now for a couple of weeks and have had no issues. I like that it came with different size holders for what ever size phone you may have. Can adjust phone to vertical or horizontal safely. I definitely would purchase this mount again or as a gift for someone.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I bought the Roam Universal phone holder for my spin bike. When I’m getting set up for a ride, it’s super easy to park my phone in the dock with just one hand and then secure it with the corner bungees when I’m ready to get in the saddle. Whether I’m listening to some bumpin music or following along with an online spin class, my phone is secure, out of the way (I sometimes flail my arms and belt out song lyrics, it caused problems with securing my phone before), in easy view, and well within reach to change things up or answer a call. I wish I could speak to durability, but I just haven’t had it long enough. Setup was super quick and easy though. I tend to boggle when I’ve forgotten to set things up before I ride. But, I woke up, got dressed, attached my phone dock, and started my ride. It seriously took one minute, and I’m pretty sure it only took that long because I fiddled with where to place it on my handlebars. So far, great product. I’m planning to buy two more for our outdoor bikes and another when I start riding my motorcycle again."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","We bought two of these, one for an iPhone X, one for a Galaxy S9+. Both phones fit perfectly, using the two larger silicone pieces. The mount itself is super sturdy and did not loosen during some rigorous trail riding. The silicone ""wraps"" also stayed in place.  Pros: price point, stability, flexibility Cons: [VERY MINOR] not intuitive to install, printed instructions lead to a website that didn't exist (404), silicone flaps a bit on the sides that are not affixed to phone, secured by thumb screws so mount can be stolen if left unmonitored  THESE MOUNTS ARE A FANTASTIC BARGAIN I am just a very critical reviewer, so take my minor flaws as exactly that. All of the mentioned shortcomings are easily addressed with some tweaking and ingenuity."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I am very impressed with this phone mount. It is about the third I've gotten from different vendors and this is indeed, by far, the best. I have a Galaxy S8+ and it fits perfectly! It is solidly secured and maintained steadily in place via six separate points of contact. I have no concerns whatsoever that it may fall during my mountain biking rides. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with two additional silicone nets, one small and two large ones, especially due to the size of my Galaxy S8+ which is even wider due to a heavy duty protective case it has. It also holds my Galaxy Note 4, also with a heavy duty case, easily. I am also very satisfied with the handlebar clamp. Due to its over size jaws, I can literally clamp it any place without a problem. I highly recommend and endorse this product!"

Did 1,000 miles this weekend and this mount did not move. I can't believe for the price that this thing works the way it does. My Boyfriend & Dad ran out and bought one for their bikes. This is legit and definitely worth the purchase!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","The mount is sturdy and solid. Was skeptical at first as I ride over railroad tracks and was afraid my phone would get dislodged. The phone didn't move. Installing it on my bike was easy after watching the video. There are extra silicone nets included so I will be using this for years to come.  I was looking to mount my phone on a grocery cart for shopping. Those were more expensive than this one so I bought another one. It's definitely over kill, but it economically does the job.  Highly recommend it."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Understand, this is a review of the mount right after I took it out of the box. So, I can't report as to it's tested durability. I'm going to use this on my road bike while its on my trainer so it won't be subjected to anything that could make my phone slip or come out. The phone is attached with strong, spring-loaded side grabbers and further strapped in at the corners. Cool thing is, my phone fits in it without having to remove the case I use on it.  The mount attaches to the handlebars with a clamp that's tightened with a long thumb screw. You get an extra thumb screw (nice touch) and you get two more of the stretchy rubber things that hold the phone at the corners.  I'm not sure if I'd use this whilst out banging on my mountain bike but I think it's ideal for indoor training."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I admit I was a little skeptical when reading the reviews. In short, I think users have been tightening their - yes, plastic - mount too tight to the bar and on the swivel. I have mine tightened with a soft grip (that is, not a dead-man's grip) and has not shifted, fallen, or broke in the 6 months I've been using it. And I have hit my fair share of pot holes and bumps along the way. (I ride a Honda CB1100 - factory shocks)  The great thing about this though that I like, is the rubber gripper. They are offset to allow the buttons on the side of my phone to not be pressed by the clamp. (I have been using a Pixel 3 with no case) It also meant I had to offset the clamp on the bar, but that was an easy change. Now all I need is a thin waterproof case and I'll feel better about travelling somewhere new in the rain.  One thing I don't like is the rubber tabs on the gripper. They get in the way of my screen. Small things like the mph zone I'm currently in, miles to go before next direction, and smaller things like my notification bar (not really something I need to look at, tbh). I don't like focusing my sight on my dash any longer than a second and I find myself lifting part of the tab to see how far my next turn and street name is.  Still using it! Still working great. All parts have lasted through rain, wind, sun, etc."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I recently purchased a Specialized Ariel bicycle, but found myself needing my phone while on longer bike rides. I purchased this mount to securely hold my phone while riding, but I found that it served a dual purpose - it allows me to ride with my flashlight on my phone for more visibility. The rubber band holds my phone in place well. I appreciate that they send you extras, because I imagine after mounting and dismounting the phone, they will eventually break or wear out. I found myself wishing the actual area where you clip in the phone was a little better - while it holds the phone, it does not hold my phone with the pop socket attached or if I had a larger case. Overall, it works well and does what I need it to do."
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",I saw lots of reviews about no mounting hardware but I wasn't worried because I have a screw driver and could throw 2 self tapping screws into the frame easy enough. when went to install I found my bike already had 2 Allen head threaded studs already installed for water bottle holder. one hole on the bottle holder is round and the other is elongated so you have some play in the spacing if your bike has the pre installed studs
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机",I really purchased this device without much thought but was glad that the desgners of the device thought of so uch and made it easy to install and use. It holds the cell in place so I can use a trail mapping software to track my rides and know where I am at all times. The device works like a charm and is a great value for the price. I have seen much more expensive devices that do not work ear as well. Very happy indeed.
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","Got this to go on my Honda Grom. It fits perfectly and holds my phone great. I have the Galaxy S9, and my friend has a Note 9. It holds both perfectly snug.  UPDATE: I now own the Pixel 4 and it fits great. I was just in an accident on my Honda grom. I had my phone securely mounted in this mount. I hit a deep pothole doing 30mph around a tight curve, my back end went way up and I went OTB. I was told the bike flipped a couple of times. The bike rolled about 20 feet, and I landed 10 feet beyond that. Handle bars got tweaked, I broke the headlight housing, and gauge housing, but the phone didn't get touched. It was still securely mounted and still plugged in and charging. My phone was probably safer in this mount than my pocket. 10/10 will recommend!!!"
"Roam Bike 手机支架 - 可调节摩托车手机支架车把,适用于电动、山地、滑板车和越野自行车 - 自行车手机支架兼容 iPhone 和 Android 手机","I have been using this for the past week of daily bike rides and it's held up well so far. Installation is very easy, and through all the bumps and turns on my routes the mount doesn't move or flop around. If you have a larger phone (I have a galaxy A71 with a larger case) it might be a trickier fit, you just have to stretch the silicone webbing a bit - I'm hoping it will be easier after repeated use. But if you have anything but the very largest phones, it should fit no problem."

I get lost in the trails when mountain biking a lot and end up stopping just to bring my phone out of the pocket. I wanted to get something that would hold up the phone well without too much shaking on the trail. Works better than I thought it would. See video attached. My phone is a pixel 3 XL with a 6.3 inch screen. I never locked it and it held it just as well..  It came with 4 silicone/rubber like things to adjust to the handlebars. My handlebar is a bit thicker towards the stem so I removed 3 of them and it works just fine.
"自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架-Lamicall 摩托车车把手机夹,摩托车手机夹,适用于 Phone 11 / Phone 11 Pro Max、S9、S10 等 4.7 英寸 - 6.8 英寸手机","Straight out of the box I knew I was going to love it. Feels solid, looks sleek, easy to assemble and install/remove, simple to insert phone (one handed), padding everywhere your phone makes contact to better hold, prevent damage, and absorb shock. There's a lock switch on the rear, so your phone is locked in. Even without the lock in place your phone is held securely. Holder pivots in all directions easily, but not so easily where it will move when riding on bumpy surfaces. The rear camera on phone is slightly obstructed by the extending bar in back, but a tiny zoom and the obstruction is gone. This is great if you want to record your rides from your point of view. Front facing camera is not obstructed if you want to also use that option. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max with a slim case, and my phone had no issue fitting in the holder. I took a risk going with an item that didn't have many reviews on Amazon, but so far I'm glad I did. Great product Lamicall!"

Once I received my second order; So far I can honestly this little gadget works great! I have and iPhone 11 max pro with a OtterBox pink defender case. I’m a high school teacher and I walked on concrete so having a good protective case was necessary. Any ways the gadget hold my iPhone 11 max pro with my OtterBox case. Now it does take a little bit of wiggling to get it inside the holder but once it’s in it’s in. There’s no sliding out. I like the fact that you can rotate your phone easily. Great item!!!

I already lightly bumped the mount & it lost its hold on the angle setting. I retightened but it feels kind of week. I'm afraid it won't take the vibrations from the bike. We will see. UPDATE... it did move out of adjustment pretty easily so, I ended up using some handlebar grip glue on the ball mount & screwed the plastic adjustment down tight. Now it seems to stay where I set it. The handlebar clamp comes with rubber shims & it does not seem to have an issue with staying put. This mount will work now just don't bump it to hard. The only thing holding it is an 1/8th inch thick plastic plastic shaft with a plastic ball at the end that goes into the back of the phone mount & gets screwed down. UPDATE... After reading about my issues with the product, this company contacted me. They have great support & great customer service. They sent me a new & upgraded version of the holder that is much sturdier than the original one. They really took care of me."

Additionally I have one of the biggest, fastest, electric scooters that you can buy.  Now according to Amazon I’ve had my phone mount 126 days. Which by my calculations is roughly 750 miles, at an average speed of 30mph. I can’t even begin to count the number of bumps, potholes, manhole covers, short stops, clueless motorists, and curbs I’ve encountered in that time. But not once did I have to worry about my phone because the Lamicall phone mount allows me to have three of the things I love together safely.  It’s simple to use, easily accommodates my iPhone 11 promax with a case, installed in minutes, and complements my handlebars. I couldn’t recommend it more.  Thanks guys! PS. I’ll work on getting better pictures posted."

After testing different mounts and doing tons of nosing around for different designs I can say emphatically that as far as I’m concerned this is the most secure bicycle phone mount on the market — especially for those who don’t want to have to change out their existing phone case for one custom made for a specific mount. I can access all the side buttons in my iPhone 10s and feel absolutely confident that I won’t dislodge the phone while using it. The multiple locking points greatly reinforce this assurance. Plus it’s super user friendly. As an impatient New Yorker, I appreciate how fast it is to insert and remove my phone from the mount. All I can say is, if you are skeptical about this product, don’t be. I was in your shoes and I’m happy I made the purchase. THIS PRODUCT IS THE REAL DEAL AND IT WORKS!!! Buy it and see for yourself!"

The clamping system works with your existing phone and its existing case and holds it very securely. It melt easily to The Handlebar and The Handlebar bracket is secure and also provides either portrait or landscape viewing and will tilt keep the sun off of the face of your cell phone. I looked at many many other options and none where is well-made, flexible in mounting insecure as this one. The competition that uses either silicone or rubber bands aren't even close. Do yourself a favor and buy this one. The few extra dollars you pay or well worth it and will save you from having to buy a replacement for your expensive phone :-)"

This being affordable and good reviews I chose this one. This was so easy to install which I like since being a single mom. Lol. Also you can position your phone sideways if you like but my daughter didn’t want the phone sideways. I did however have to install the part that clamps to the handlebar in a different position because of the placement where my daughter wanted the mount. She didn’t want the mount on the actual handlebar. She wanted the mount on the neck(I guess it’s what you call it) of the handlebar. So her phone is positioned in center of handlebars.Right above the handlebar reflector. It comes with everything needed for attaching and also comes with plenty of rubber grip pieces that goes between mount and handlebars. Not all bars are the same thickness so you can stack the rubber anti slip grips if needed. Finding the right rubber anti slip grips is what took me the longest. After that I had the entire thing attached in 5 minutes. Overall it’s great,snug,rugged,and hasn’t fallen off. We’ve had it attached about 3 mos now. The lock mechanism is great too. No worries about phone slipping out on bumpy terrain. She likes slim phone cases and we don’t have to remove any of her phone cases to put her phone into bike phone holder. It grips phone nicely w/o locking it but I like the extra added peace of mind. Lol. I just wish I would of gotten a bike phone holder that totally covered her phone because one day on her bike ride home she did get caught in a lil rain but luckily her phone didn’t get too wet. Other then the waterproof issue it’s a good phone holder. You can’t beat it for the price.  PS: my daughter said as for rain she will carry a zip loc bag. Lol. We tried it and this DIY hack works well. Lol"

Most of the mounts out there use stretchy rubber bands that are finicky to put around the phone and block the screen, and all have mixed reviews. This mount feels premium - the grips are extremely secure. It is very easy to place the phone in it and remove it, it has lots of adjustability and when tightened it does not move or bounce at all, even on light mountain bike trails. My only wish is that it had a quick release clamp so I can move it form bike to bike if needed, but other than that it is perfect."

I bought one of these for my wife, who is incredibly hard on stuff, and she loves it, and it held her 6 Pro on our mountain bike trails and her ham-fisted usage. She was so happy with it, I bought one for myself! It has several rubber pieces to accommodate any size handlebar position. I put it on the center, fattest part of my bar with one strip, while my wife wanted it farther near her grip where her bar is thinner and used two strips. It's like the old cereal commercial, and she is Mikey; if she likes it, it's great! Entrusting $1K phones is no laughing matter, and this handles it."

I bought two of these and used them on a Harley and a mountain bike. The phone is on solid. I've gone over some big bumps and while the holder might move a smudge, it easily slides back. I did not want to over-tighten the plastic fasteners. The locking feature is nice even though it's not needed. The phone will not come off this holder. I've used the rubber holder type phone holders and they are a pain to take on and off. This one is quick, easy, and sturdy. Worth every penny."

I ride a 2003 VTX 1800 C and I believe the bars are around 1"". The mount was held securely in place with 2 of the 4 supplied rubber shims and barely moved over the course of 6 days of riding (10 hours per day typically). I didn't remove the mount during this time (I cover my bike at night) and all I had to do was tighten it periodically. However, it would have been secure even without my tightening it down one time. The lock feature works great, but I did forget to engage it one time and the phone did not move anymore noticeably (though of course for piece of mind you should always lock it, as I usually do).  I would absolutely buy this mount again. The only thing I wish was that it didn't block my camera so I could use it as pseudo go-pro but that is a minor complaint and obviously not the intended us. I can't speak to its longevity as this was my first outing with it but I assume it will serve me well for sometime. Additionally, at the price point, even if it doesn't last too long it will have been worth it."

I ordered an new holder and the manufacturer says they have a 1 year full warranty. Si I Emailed Lamicell asking for a refund or a replacement for the broken phone holder. Their warranty says all Emails will be responded to within 24 hours. WELL 2 emails and 20 days later NO RESPONSE. I told the I preferred no to leave a negative review but here it is.

I was worried that it would not hold or even drop my phone as my motorcycle is not the smoothest bike out there vibrates like a Harley should. Motorcycle is a 2005 Harley FLHTCUI with some engine mods on it which is my daily. The mount has only seen 700 plus miles to include a short 400+ mile ride that had decent twisting roads and some semirough highway roads with zero issues. It didnt even budge or shift on bumps potholes hard take offs and some strong rain and winds. I was worried that for price it would be horrible or had to be constantly adjusted and so far pleasantly surprised. My work and personal phone both fit with no issues, one is a LG K20 Plus with tech 21 case the other an i-Phone XR with otterbox case both zero issues with fitment. That being said I still have my doubts for an adventure bike that sees more rough rodes but for the majority of riders I highly recommend and you cant beat the price. Also not for those who want to use the rear camera on the phone but does not interfere with charging port which is also a big plus. Would buy again."

Several of the most negative said that the holder didn't fit his cell phone as his cell was too large for the holder. Another said that his cell phone fell out of the holder. My first take on this holder is to wonder how either of these two statements could be true. Firstly this thing has an expanding ratcheting mechanism which extends very far. It extends way beyond want is needed for my iPhone X; I also have a thick case over my phone which fits in the holder fine. Secondly, the holder has a locking lever on the back that locks the gears in place so the phone is secure. Yes, you have to put the thing together and the instructions are not the greatest but the only two things I think could cause you to lose your phone would be to forget to lock it down or that the ball was not correctly seated from the clamp to the holder."

I switched to this from the rubber band strapped one and love it so much more. Def holds the phone in place but also has a swivel when want positioned differently. It does not block any of the screen or confuse the iPhone touchscreen like the rubber band ones do. Moderately easier to use with motorcycle riding gloves on too. I’ve read reviews of the back switch lock clip breaking easier so I’m mindful to be gentle and no issues yet.
"自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架-Lamicall 摩托车车把手机夹,摩托车手机夹,适用于 Phone 11 / Phone 11 Pro Max、S9、S10 等 4.7 英寸 - 6.8 英寸手机","I was hoping I'd be able to mount this on my Piaggio's mirror stem since no handlebar is available. It worked. I had to keep all of the rubber inserts and added about an 1/8"" of friction tape. The Piaggio mirror stem is about .5"" and this mount goes down to .6"". The friction tape did the job and keeps it from slipping on the stem. One thing I did notice is that no matter how tight I tightened the ball connector on the back of the phone mount it would still have a tendency to let the bottom of the phone slip down on bumpy roads. Since the ball connector tightener is plastic I didn't want to over-tighten and cause it to break. To keep the phone from slipping down I adjusted the clamp around the mirror stem so the stem attached to the ball stops it from going down any farther and it stays in place now. The quick tighten and release clamp is a pro and con. It's super easy to mount quickly but someone could also easily take it off and borrow the phone mount. You could use a regular bolt if concerned about that. The phone is also very secure in the mount. I've ridden without using the lock and had no worries of my phone falling off. I'm very happy with this inexpensive phone mount."

I mounted it in the center of my frame closest to my handlebars to keep it aligned (instead of moving with the handlebars). The mounting is rock solid as it comes with removable rubber strips to fit most any size tubing and has a ""spin"" clamp to adjust the tension. The unit is very sturdy and holds my Samsung J7 Crown tightly. The swivel/tilt is a nice feature which allows you to position it perfectly in view. The locking of the ball swivel could be a little more tight. It doesn't really move but I'm sure if I hit a few large ""moguls"" it would certainly move. I'm pleased with it so far and would recommend it."

After receiving it and using a few times I agree that it is excellent quality. I can tell you that it works well for my iPhone X with Otterbox Defender Case which is a pretty thick case. It doesn't fit as well as the iPhone alone or the iPhone with a thinner case - but it does hold it snugly without allot of effort to get in the holder. I did peel off the thin rubber pad that was part of the holder just to buy a bit of extra space. But it worked with the pad in there also, just a bit better without it. But the phone is already in a protective case so did not see much purpose for the thin pad for my use anyways. If you buy it, you will be happy. very easy to mount, I have it on a mountain bike. The ball bart of the mount that allows for pivoting etc., I was very happy with how tight it held the phone in place once I had it set to the angle I wanted. no complaints there at all. I will be buying another for my wife's bike too."

Downside is the items given to put on the bike are either almost too thick or not enough padding for hold and tightness on the bike. Pic shows it’s installed on the thicker part of the handles but it was too loose on there so I had to place it on the thinner bar, which isn’t bad but not my first preference. The lock is a little difficult to lock and unlock, but that’s essentially a good thing as you know it won’t just unlock on its own. Overall, I like the phone holder. I did flip it the opposite was as the picture shows and I feel it has more support, but it’s your bike and your phone. Do what makes you feel better! I RECOMMEND this product."

I have a Google Pixel 5 with a 3 credit card holder case so it's about twice as thick as a standard cell phone by itself. This case not only accepted it but even had room for an XL phone if you have one. Packaging is nice and quality appears to be great. Locking feature is solid keeping the phone from bouncing out on rugged and bumpy terrain though I'm not sure it would fall out even if I I kept it unlocked due to a strong spring snug fit feature. The only part I feel could be improved would be the locking tab itself which is a skinny flat tab that slides left and right. I feel like this would be the first thing to break of after regular use or overtime as the weather and elements start to effect the brittleness of plastic. I can't say it won't last, just something I'm going to monitor over the next few days/weeks. Other than that, the mount is of high quality design and build in all other aspects and I'd highly recommend if performance is your biggest factor."

The key is the lock feature, which prevents the springs from expanding. It does not require any special attachments to your phone and will accommodate a variety of sizes.  Two features to be aware of. First, the lock is pretty strong and sometimes takes a lot of pressure to unlock. I think this is good for keeping you phone in place but it does require a good tug. Second, I have a Pixel 5a that unlocks using a fingerprint scan at the back of the phone. This becomes inaccessible while in the cradle so I need to use my pin instead. Not a big deal but I have gotten rather use to the fingerprint unlock."

Was hesitant to mount a phone holder on my mountain bike in case things get rough on the trail, crash, etc but this has worked out great. I moved to a new area and don't know these trails, so I like to either have the map open on my phone as I ride, or at least have quick access to it. Having to stop riding and get my phone from my bag is a super minimal inconvenience, but enough of one that I bought this.  So far I've ridden some pretty rough/bumpy trails on my hardtail and there has been no slipping, no turning/moving, no creeping up the handlebars. I haven't done any big jumps or impacts, but I'm really impressed with how well this held my phone in place and stayed where I mounted it on the bar. I also REALLY like the lock feature on the back; I was worried a hard bump might knock my phone out of the holder but that solves that worry.  The only downside I would note is that it does stick off the bars a little more than I'd like; I would prefer a lower profile. Just feels like if you wrecked or went OTB you're at risk of hitting it and/or damaging your phone. But, that's just part of the game. It's a great design and I would definitely recommend it for standard mountain bikers wanting to have quick access to map, strava, etc. Hardcore downhill riding or excessive impact could be too much for this thing, but I think it's an awesome accessory."

I couldn't find one I liked better than this one. So, I bought another one.  This one is so easy to pop your phone in and out of, and I've never had a phone accidently pop out, despite the fact that I don't use the lock feature.  I ride on a fairly bumpy, but paved trail, so I can't speak as to how it would perform on a rough mountain bike trail, but my guess is, with the lock on it would do well.

I am using it to hold my phone on a expandable camera pole. I operate the camera wirelessly by the phone.  The clamp is strong, adjustable and comes with three rubber straps that you fit to your mounting tube. The ball/socket holds very tightly but still allows for minor adjustments. The best part is the phone holder. It is the best I've used. It opens easily by pushing on one end. The other end slides and opens at the same time. You put your phone in and it closes on both ends. I have a Samsung S9 and an iPhone XR. Both are in Otterbox cases. The plastic arms of the holder fit over the front edges of the case. This holds the phone completely secured. I have not found another holder that does that. There is also a lock on the back side of the holder. I absolutely recommend this for anyone using a larger phone with a case. It is perfect!!"

It just fits my Samsung 10 Plus size. It can be swiveled from vertical to horizonal while riding with a turn of the wrist. It has a locking lever on the back of the holder you engage to make sure the holder stays snug against your phone so it cant accidentally be released. I like that feature. My last holder didnt have that feature and thats the main reason for buyingbthis one. Best of all it secures to your handlebars with a quick release, so easy to take on and off and tighten. I would highly recommend. Seems substantial compared to my last one. The arms that retract to fit your phone are made of some type of metal compared to being plastic or rubber. Give it a try!"

I know the purpose is as a phone holder, but also wanted the ability to take pictures/video facing forward while biking.

The install takes a bit if patience because you have to determine how many of the included rubber shims you need to use to secure the holder to your handle bars but that’s an acceptable trade-off for a secure mount. For this reason I would recommend getting separate holders for each bicycle because you probably don’t want to deal with removing and reinstalling it all the time. Secondly, the lock feature is a nice feature but it takes quite a bit of hand strength to engage or disengage it. Someone with low hand strength might have a problem with this. If you’re willing to deal with these couple of minor issues it’s a great product that gives your bike a secure and super convenient smart phone display."

I use it on my bicycle on the bumpy streets of New Orleans, and the iPhone X has popped out multiple times while going over bumps and even once while just going down a steep decline from a bridge. On that one, the screen cracked, so now I have to go get it repaired, which even with AppleCare+, is going to cost me twice as much as the phone mount did. I’m going to purchase a phone mount that has rubber straps again this time. I would not recommend this mount unless you have a very smooth ride, and certainly not for any motorized vehicle."

I was worried that it would constantly be slipping on bumps but it doesn't move at all unless I intentionally move it myself. It's very adjustable so you can fine tune the angle to which your phone faces you, great for Face ID. My only complaint is the lock slider is really difficult to slide into the locked position. I've got good hand and arm strength and I still struggle with it every morning. Sliding into the unlocked position is not a problem. Overall though, I am happy with the fact that the mount doesn't move at all when I hit bumps and jumps, so I can't complain too much."

The best part of this is that it actually grips and holds your phone securely even if your phone has a case on it. Mine is the iPhone 11 with case and this holds it tight. The installation was easy and it comes with spacers to accommodate various diameters of handlebars. When closed, it does not cover the phone screen. The 'lock switch' which you activate after inserting the phone to prevent the holder from opening up, is this device's weakest feature, as it is VERY hard to move into the 'lock' position. Actually, I find that this lock/switch is unnecessary. I ride on the street but have hit plenty of rough spots which shake the bike - but the phone stays put."

The only thing I want to inform people on is it doesn’t seem to tighten down strong enough to not move at all. By that I mean when strolling the neighborhood it doesn’t move but can move fairly easily by hand for repositioning. I have not had this thing bounce around or move on me without me purposely moving it.  Overall it’s a neat accessory, fits a 12 pro max with average case on and has a functional locking feature. It’s just an accessory for a bike that I use to control music on my rides or check distance nothing too fancy. I would recommend this as a good priced holder."
"自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架-Lamicall 摩托车车把手机夹,摩托车手机夹,适用于 Phone 11 / Phone 11 Pro Max、S9、S10 等 4.7 英寸 - 6.8 英寸手机",Bought this for my Tracer 900 GT which I ride semi aggressively and it has worked great. The two things you have to pay attention to are if you engage the lock on the back of the holder so you dont try to rip your phone out of the holder when you are wondering why it wont open. You can pull hard enough that it will still open even with the lock engaged but only if you are really pulling on it(done it when in a rush). You can ride without the lock in the back engaged as the spring tension is pretty strong itself to hold your phone but overall Im paranoid so I always engaged the lock. The second thing you need to know is to make sure your phone is completely centered and seated in the holder which becomes second nature once you do it enough. If you do that it cannot fall out. Would buy again and will buy again when I grab a bicycle.

It was easy to mount, the inside rubber pieces can come out so you can get it to the exact right size for whatever bar you're mounting it to, the clips that go around the phone itself are sturdy, it expands when taking your phone out or putting it in, then contracts to hold it securely in place. It can rotate and adjust up or down, so you can angle your phone while it's still sturdily held in place for use. Great product! We will see how it lasts over time, but I am impressed thus far!"

It’s fairly easy to mount with the only difficulty coming from the shape of your handle bars and the positions of your brake and gear levers. It has a lever that clamps the mount into place. Depending on your set-up your cables might be in the way of closing this lever. I had to loosen and move my brake and gear levers out of the way to get this mount into place. You should only need to place it once so this wasn’t too much trouble.  Once it is in place all is good. It’s easy to put your phone into the mount and take it back out. It just takes a couple of seconds. The mount also swivels so you can get your phone at the angle you want and it holds your phone very securely.

I originally put it on my mountain bike and it worked very well. After using it for a month or two on the mountiain bike, i put it on my motorcycle and regularly hit the highway doing 60 and up. Phone mount never moved, just bounced around a little but i was not expecting it to be able to keep up like it does. I don't beleive it is rated for motorcycle use but it has not failed as of yet but i can see a few cheaply made parts that might give if i am not careful. ALSO, the lock on the back can be a bit of a pain to lock and unlock. Do with that what you will."

When I opened the box, I was immediately impressed w/ the quality of this item. Putting it together was easy. The directions are well written. It did take me longer than anticipated to get it situated on my handlebar tube. My only suggestion is to NOT trim the rubber inserts for a custom fit. Start out by taking out the longest 2-3 then situate the remaining ones so that they fit the curve/bracket. Save the long ones in case of future wear/tear. I have the iPhone 11 in a clear Speck case and case and all fit snugly in this mount. Again, very pleased w/ this purchase. Easy to adjust the angle and stays in place. I'm also able to keep my bike bag on the front as well as my computer mount and I still have room for my light. I have already recommended this to two other biking friends."

What initially drew me to this product was the ease of placing and removing the phone. Its a one hand operation where I simply push my phone against the top plastic piece, and the case opens up allowing me to slip my phone in.  This mechanism seems to be very robust, and I have had no issues with the phone even moving inside of the holder. This product does come with a little switch on the back to lock the phone in place, but I have never used it and have had zero problems with just the friction fit  another feature that I was looking for was an unrestricted view of the screen while riding. Other products have clasps that may interfere with your view of the screen, this one allows you to see everything, helpful when your using a map to get home.  My one wish for this product would be a metal mounting point. It uses the common ball and collar system so you can find your perfect angle and then tighten down a collar to keep it in place. Because of how you have to insert the phone, it pays to have your collar really tight so the mount doesn't move. This products mount is plastic and I have some anxiety about overtightening the collar, and subsequently snapping the plastic.  Overall this product has perfectly matched my expectations and has been an intuitive and easy product to use, while also offering excellent security for my device."

I really didn’t think they would do good in a salt water environment but they held up better than expected. They were all exposed to salt water at the beach and ruff road conditions. They will move some if you hit a big enough bump but the phones never fell out and they didn’t move much just enough to notice. My kids like them and used them every time they went for a ride.

I kept thinking, ""How hard is it to make a stupid phone holder for my bike that holds it still and won't spill it on the ground?"" I have found really solid holders that cost three times as much, but this one is s.o.l.i.d. I've been on two rides with it now, and my phone has stayed put.  It's pretty quick and easy to install and super easy to put my phone in and take it back out. It has a security lock, but I didn't even use it on today's ride.  I ride on the street and paved paths, so maybe if you ride off-road you need something more robust, but I go over many bumps on my ride and my phone stays put. Great product!"

But I could have mounted it on the handle bars also. It fits almost any bar by removing rubber pieces to help it fit. I usually don't write reviews but I really like this holder. It is spring loaded and I have a Samsung Note 9 with a otterbox on it and it goes right in. Than it has a switch that locks the spring load so it can't move. A really great product so that I can listen to podcasts while biking. I just like products that work really well. After I have it for a month I will try to come back and write a follow up.

And I’ve ridden anywhere from Green, Blue, and Black rated trails, 8’ dips and small to medium size drops with my iPhone X on this mount without locking. No movement and no issue at all.  You just have to really turn the dial ring to the absolute tightest to prevent the phone to dip. Once set, you can still tilt it slightly if needed without it dipping. Truly a 5-star phone mount. Fits my 29er’s bar."

The open sides make accessing all side buttons on the phone an easy task, everything can be done on the phone with it securely in the holder.

I would recommend this product, it is as described, and easily installs and takes up minimal room on my handles bars, I would say it would fit almost any size of bar as it comes with removable rubber pieces inside the circular clamp. Has an adjustable head mount so u can position your phone easily for sun glare. Installs in less than 5 minutes, and can be just as easily removed and repositioned to your liking."

It is a clever design and seems sturdy. It even has a lock feature that keeps the phone locked in place securely, although the spring mechanism seems pretty secure by itself.

It does not fit a bar with a cross brace well but that isn't the mount's fault. It fit much better after the trip when I changed to the ProTaper bar.

Very easy to use, sturdy, and high quality, this HAS TO BE one of the best if not the best phone mounts at this price. Soooo easy to put on and take off the phone with one hand and I never have to worry about the phone possibly coming out. I use it while delivering food on my bike and it has made things so much easier. I was worried it wouldnt fit my phone since I use a small Iphone with a very thick durable case that didnt fit well with other mounts, but due to the smart design of this mount it is able to fit in it perfectly.

I mounted it on my scooter and so far, it seems to work ok. My only problem is the plastic screw portion that tightens it to the mount.

The mount works extremely well, the materials used are thought out, and the design/mechanism is fantastic. I have phone mounts from big names, costing six times as much as this one, yet this particular phone mount beats them all. Stop looking, stop reading more reviews, that’s the mount you want.

It's a perfect product.  I bought another for my wife's bike. She agrees, it works great.  I bought another for my golf pushcart. It works perfect for that, too. I love having quick access to my GPS. I don't have to dig through my bag or into the cart, it's front and center displaying my data.  I bought another for our Peloton bike. It grips great, and allows me to have my phone available for streaming, or just to be able to check notifications without trying to get into a pocket or nearby shelf.  It's great. Buy it."

This is the only one i’ve ever bought and seems to be the only one i’ll ever need. Super easy to install and is very sturdy. Just don’t forget click on the lock on the back of the holder! I completely missed that the first time I used it and a bump in the road sent my phone flying off which was not a fun time. However after realizing there’s a lock on the back I haven’t had any problems with my phone coming loose. I definitely recommend this for whatever your choice of bike path may be.

Sure enough, it's great quality and an affordable price. I originally got this to use on Citibikes in New York City, and this mount is very easy to attach and detach.  The lock feature is kind of hard to operate, it requires more force than anticipated to slide the switch. However, I haven't needed to use the lock since the mount has an internal mechanism that is constantly applying tension to the phone. I ride only on city streets, though, and would use the lock function if mountain biking."

Further, you don’t need a special case for your phone. Your existing phone will lock right in. The trade off is that it’s a little bulkier in size that some other phone holders I’ve seen. This is “nit picky”, but I wish there was a hole on it to allow phone video while it’s locked on. I really like it though."

Had a few of the silicone/rubber band style actually damage my iPhone because they place too much stress on the middle while pulling the corners. Causes the housing to bend on rough terrain.

The lick feature is ok but honestly the phone stays on even with or without the lock because of the spring mechanism. Very good to hold phone and use as a GPS for navigation or to listen to music while biking. Only thing is I wish it were easy to install/uninstall so I could easily move it to another bike or use it for something else.

One pic shows just the low beams and the other pic shows the bright beams. BIG difference from my other headlights but this were just the bright Sylvania brand lights from Wal-Mart. These LED's blow the wal-mart stuff out of the water!! I will most definitely feel safer on the highway at night and on the dirt and gravel roads at night!! I love these!!! Very easy to install!

Low Beam light is bulky on install , make sure you tuck wire and box in snug to get the weather proof cap back on correctly , I had to try a couple times , I went from behind the wheel well , High Beam has plenty of room to tuck wire and box back in and get a good seal with the cap on the 2015 F-150 head lights. Make sure you turn the lights all the way until they are vertical or you hear them click in otherwise they make get loose and fall out or rattle around"

They are very bright compare to other bulbs such as diodes dynamics. The light output is very high. I live in rural area and these make a huge difference when driving at night. That was the only thing I hated about my f150.  Pros:  Very bright, long life span, they do not blind other drivers, fit with dust covers on in f150  Cons: They are on expensive side compare to other bulbs but well worth it."

I also want to rave that Sealight has amazing customer service. I purchased the wrong bulbs for the high beams in a two pack that include high and low. I contacted them to get the correct pair, and they shipped the correct pair immediately. They arrived in two days! All I had to do was return the pair that didn’t fit without hassle.

"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","These guys were definitely an upgrade for me in my subaru forester 2015 with stock lights. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, these things are bright! I've been running stock halogen lights from subaru and these were one of the things I wanted to get into for a start in modding my car. I know, it's just lights, but everyone's gotta start somewhere. The lights compatability was highlighted when I was browsing around on Amazon. I had to do a bit of research because the subaru manual called the low beams h 11 and the high beams hb3. But ultimately both fit and work as intended. Now, when im driving during the day, the low beam lights are impeccably bright! But I'm fine with that. When at night, even when I'm in the 'O' position, the low beam lights (aka the day time running lights) are already bright enough. If course, your taillights should be on as well and switching to auto allows you to get both. Install took about an hour only because is new to any car installation. But everything was pretty simple and i was able to get them on quick. I can't speak for the longevity since it's only been a week since i installed, but no flickering this far."

The new set works flawlessly. I will update the review over time with any changes and longevity."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","First off, PLEASE IGNORE THE ""VEHICLE COMPATIBILITY"" box if it says it doesnt fit your vehicle. I can attest that it said these WOULD NOT fit my 2019 Honda Crv, yet the bulb req. for my car were a perfect match. Just make sure you know both the H# HB#, and 9### , your vehicle needs and if you buy these just pick the correct ones and buy with confidence. Now for the review... flawless.. comes with the driver (conversion ballast board) already hard wired to the housing of the led replacement. Then its literally plug and play. Took 4 min to replace all 4 bulbs. I also have a high power consumption car audio system (3k watts) on my stock alternator, and with it thumping away, the lights never flickered once, so voltage is perfect for these. I recommend you get the package bundle for both your high and low beams instead of just one or the other. The confusion your electrical system will have if you use a combo of halogen and led will be rough. Just get both and problem solved. These make no noise thru the electrical system, and as i said i am running an aftermarket audio system so if there was line noise of any kind i would hear it especially well. Overall grade... A+ ... you have just added a new loyal customer!"
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",I purchased these bulbs for my 2018 F150 which had very dim halogen high and low beams. I had a problem with one of the bulbs flickering. The seller sent me a replacement set which resolved the issue. They were fast to ship the replacement. This bulbs are very bright and much safer than the OEM product. They were very easy to replace. Can't beat the price.
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","These lights appear to be well made. I used H11s and 9005s for the low beams and high beams respectively in my 2019 Ram 1500 Big Horn. Other reviewers have focused on the lights, so I’ll focus on the install.  High Beams: you can get to them from under the hood as you would expect. The main challenge is that Ram left very little slack in the wires so unsnapping the old bulbs is a little challenging. Attaching the new leads not has bad. The main thing to note is that for these 9005s you can not achieve a 9:00 o’clock and 3 o’clock position for the LED bulbs once you lock the 3 tabs in place. More like 8:00 o’clock and 2:00 o’clock. The original halogens fit the same but of course they are round. I had to settle for this position which for the brights is probably fine.  Low Beams (the PIAs): to install these you actually have to do it from underneath by removing 3 fenderwell screws and peeling back the plastic fenderwells; a bit unsettling. Backing out the original bulb is fine with one arm. To unsnap the connector however you have to insert both arms which is very tight and you have to work blindly. It’s is very tedious in part because again Ram left very little slack in the wires. Snapping in the new H11s is just as bad. You have to insert two arms in there. Installing the bulbs was very challenging as well because it’s not easy to stretch around and view the bulb position through the front lens while you have both arms in the fenderwell. The good news is that the 3:00 o’clock and 9:00 o’clock position can be achieved with the H11s.  The high beams and low beams both worked without any flickering or warning light on the dash.  Pro Tip: Before you start this job, have a glass of wine and listen to some relaxing music as it’s a bit of a PIA!"

Flash forward to March 2, 2022, I am driving home from work and a deer decides that it’s going to essentially jump into my car not in front of my car into my car it leapt up and shattered my headlight, pushed my hood over, dented it and then proceeded to rolldown the side of my car taking out my driver side mirror and denting my door thank god it stopped after that, NOW if I had had a normal basic/boring headlight bulb I could tell you right now that it would’ve shattered inside of the housing and would’ve been so hard to get out, but that’s not what happened my headlight bulbs both highbeam and low beam are still intact, and best believe I was greatful I was able to keep my headlights on and drive my little car home in the dark…. You know what bulb did break though? my turn signal bulb that was just a regular factory glass bulb….shattered…gone….so I’m just saying…if you wanna almost blind people with the power of the sun and go through a deer rampage and still have a working headlight…buy these….don’t add to your wishlist…don’t add to cart and think about it just ONE CLICK BUY….

Put a high/low set on my wife's car and they were great, however I recently had an issue and needed to contact customer support. This is where the company shines. They were amazing. Incredibly responsive and quick to react. Not only did they immediately dispatch a replacement set, but since they were out of stock of my model, they gave me an upgraded set free of charge. Now THAT is customer service. I've had recent customer service horror stories so it's great to see a company that makes a great product and stands by it. Makes all the difference.

The quality of of the material seems good however I’m having an issue with the beam pattern as seen in the photo. When I installed the the bulb I made sure that position of the bulb was vertical in the housing. I will try to change the position to see if that helps.  Update Oct 15, 2020  I don’t think the bulbs seal in the housing. I keep finding moisture in the housing. The low beam has a dust cover to cover it so I don’t think the water is getting in the housing that way. The high beam bulb doesn’t seem to have the best fitment in the housing. Even when it twisted and locked into position it seems lose. I have also purchased a set for my fog lights and those too have let moisture in the housing. I have taken the bulb out and let the housing dry 2 times already.

Well, no joy for installation of any bulb as you have to do multiple steps to remove the bulb housings to replace any of them, so I replaced all my bulbs at once with LEDs. All the bulbs are brighter. Only criticism I have is that it was hard to tell within the package which bulbs were high beam and which were low beam. I tried to figure it out without lifting the foam. The bulbs don't tell you, but the model numbers are stamped on the cords that can be found when you lift the foam. Also, the connectors are different, so there is no possibility of error. Super bright and a much wider spectrum of light (you can see the difference - like pure white light that makes regular headlights looked yellow by comparison). I could not be happier! Cannot speak to longevity but I'm one month in with great results so far."

The kit came with 2 sets of bulbs for those who need to know (1 set of H11, 1 set of 9005), in a very nice box. The kit also included a set of soft gloves, zip ties, and the standard packaging info.  The only challenges I had were the twist in alignment feature, the video will help with this, and getting the middle modules in the wiring in a safe place to prevent melting. This could just be my inexperience though. Both were an easy fix when I saw what I was doing  These lights are super bright, (video is at 730pmish, when there was still decent light out) a very clean white, and amazing. Add in they were prime shipped and I had them in less than 24 hours, and ita great overall. I count be happier. Sealight is an amazing brand i will 100% seek out to get my other bulbs from."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","I usually do not write reviews unless I genuinely find my opinion to be helpful for others and save them a lot of time.  If you own a 5th Gen 4Runner and are looking for a pair of LED's for your stock halogens, these unfortunately do not fit.  I know several vehicle owners, especially Ford owners that use Sealight products and overall the lineup is great, but for the sake of business and saving people a trip to the local return center or post office; please correct your product fitments or put a disclaimer for which cars this does not work for.  Three out of four of the lights worked fine, they put out great light from such a good quality frame, the fanless heat sink is brilliant and I prefer that over the LED's with the fans. However, the passenger side headlamp Low Beam (inside the dust cap) does not fit. For some reason the way the headlight is designed, the heat sink is too large to fully fit the bulb into locking position. I tried desperately to make this product fit, but it did not budge. I had no choice but to return these great bulbs and find another brand.  So if you are not a 4Runner owner and are a Ford owner or own another make, please go ahead and buy Sealights, they are an amazing bulb for other vehicles. But 4Runner owners (2020) in my case, you will have to look elsewhere unfortunately until Sealight is able to either make one for the 4runner with a smaller heat sink."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Excellent value LED headlights. I put them in my 2016 Ford F-150 and it took maybe 20 minutes to install low beam and high beam lights. I really dig the upgrade and for under $100 it's a smart upgrade. I didn't like my truck's stock headlights. The warmer toned halogens were OK but I work outdoors and often in the cooler months the sun isn't out for long and I end up having to drive in the dark in the evening or use my headlights for some work. These Sealights are an upgrade. I'd say that they're probably 20-25% brighter than stock but I'm not getting flashed as cars pass me because the focus is still pretty straight forward. The biggest difference is in the high beams though, which definitely fill the areas in front of me much better than OEM halogen bulbs. These were very easy to install for me and for into my truck lamp slots with the extra cable just fine. Depending on what you're coming from these may not be Earth shattering bulbs but they're much more efficient and they are brighter than most OEM bulbs. I am buying fog lights from the same MFTR to have LEDs across the board. If you're running and SUV or truck and feel that the light you get from these aren't enough then you may wanna consider a light bar to help push even more light out there because while you can get birghter lights, you'll spend much more and may have to modify the fittings of your lights or else they won't fit. I think everyone should be driving at night with good headlights and until OEMs get their game up you can do yourself a favor and pick up a headlamp upgrade. As long as these last several years I will have zero complaints."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Fit my older Honda Pilot without issue. Install was fairly easy but does take some reaching and groping around in my particular vehicle to get access to the old lights. All in all it took about 20 mins and that was at night and in cold temperatures with a couple of breaks for before and after pics. Better lighting and unfrozen fingers I could have done this more quickly.  Brightness and color are amazing. I wish I had done this sooner. The output on dark city streets, rainy city roads at night and dark country roads is now similar to a luxury vehicle I have with factory LEDs. Before I put the LED in I did not like driving the dark roads at night with my Honda. Now it’s very clear and light seems to project further down the road."

"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装"," These replacement bulbs were exactly what I needed to replace my factory halogens. Even brand new, halogens are yellowish and just awful, especially once you've had LEDs. I have a 22 Subaru Crosstrek Sport and both hi and lo bulbs were a breeze to replace. I replaced hi/lo/fog all within 30min, which the fogs took the most effort as I had to get under the front end. End result is fantastic. A lot of haters hate on these ""cheapo"" replacement bulbs, as they are in a reflector housing and supposedly spray the light all over blinding oncoming traffic. Not exactly the case, people need to read more before typing BS. Some folks may install improperly, or there are other reasons they blind others. These are engineered to place th4e LED diodes in the EXACT placement as the OG halogen filaments, and they shoot out to the sides when inserted properly, not up and down, so the light pattern sprays in the same area/pattern as the halogens. Get some... Oh, and when the lights are ""off"", the DRLs still work as intended (hi beams) as nice, white light (not reduced wattage/voltage causing yellow tint) with no flickering. All good!"

I can tell you that it is a world of difference from the factory. Anyone driving at night can attest to dullness of their halogen bulbs. These LED lights make a world of a difference. I watched a video online to make the replacement easier. 7/32 socket and 3 bolts later and you can pull back the wheel fender for easier access. I only had installed for 1 day so, I cannot speak to longevity. Make the change, you will not be disappointed. Update: I absolutely love these lights. I can tell you that other drivers hate them. Everyone flashes then goes full high beam till I hit them with my new ""God said let there be light"" high beams. That usually changes their mind. If you are on the fence about these, be like Nike and just do it. You won't be disappointed."

First Order of Business, the GM engineer who oversaw the high and low bulb replacement procedure should suffer death by 1000 high and low beam changes (that's 4000 bulb changes)! GRRRR! If you have this car, you know what I'm talking about. Anyway...  Now to the Sealight bulbs, They fit perfectly, the little box and the plug can be shoved into the bottom of the housing so you can replace the caps on the back of the headlamps after completion. The whiteness and brightness of these bulbs are unreal. No more yellow lights!  Some tips if you have a Traverse. You'll need some dynamite. Just kidding. Anyway, remove the two T20 Torx from the wheel well. Remove the two from the underside of the fender shield. Now, remove the radiator cover. You'll have to pry the stupid fasteners up and almost ruin them but hey, in for a Penny in for a Pound right? Make sure you unhook both sides of the weather strip near the windshield, just one plastic clip on each side (just pull up on the weatherstrip and leave the little white fastener in place). When you remove the shield, you will have a LITTLE more room to get to the high beams. I used the top to hold the high beams up after I plugged them in then I went in through the fender to fish them down and install them. The high beam cap was also installed from the top but turned from the fender well. Whatever side you are working on, turn the wheel in. Make sure the weather strip on your caps remain installed. Also before you button everything up, look at your headlights. My high beam bulbs looked not exactly vertical but it was my fault, I just didn't twist them all the way. It was weird because they both were off the same degree. Fortunately I noticed before I wrestled with the caps.  Finally, these are pictures while driving and at similar locations. If I was smart I would have taken pictures stationary and at a specific distance with a sign in view. Oh well, the pictures I took don't do the Sealight LED head light bulbs any justice but I am extremely happy with them. Any changes and I will post them here."

"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","I have a 2015 Ford F-150. When one of the high beam bulbs burnt out, I began searching for replacement bulbs. I was surprised at how factory replacement halogen bulbs were quite expensive. I looked on Amazon and came across these LED replacement kit and thought, nice! I’ve always been one of those who hated and got angry at those drivers who had the surgery bright and blinding headlights. I was very afraid that these LED bulbs would make me one of those people. It didn’t. They are much brighter than the factory bulbs, certainly, but after adjusting the angles a little, and the bulbs design, I know I don’t have to worry about blinding other drivers at night.  These are more of a daylight LED bulbs. Much brighter and more intense than factory and standard bulbs. Light does travel further ahead and you are able to see much better further away.  The kit does include 2 high beam and 2 low beam LED bulbs. It also includes a pair of cotton gloves for handling the bulbs. You don’t want to get grease, oil, or dirt onto the bulb elements because it can cause the bulbs to overheat and burn out very quickly. The bulbs are “plug and play” in that you don’t need to install or purchase anything else to connect these to your vehicle. Some other, and earlier models, didn’t have the converters built in so you had to have an additional adapter. These, you just plug them in with the existing wiring. That easy."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","I bought these for my 2017 Ford F-150 to replace the old incandescent bulbs. Somewhere in my search for LEDs it was stated that they were for off-road use only. I know we have all seen new cars with LED head lamps all over the roads. Also, people driving with extreme bright LED light bars on with no thought of blinding the on-coming traffic. So I bought these and they provide a very nice wide angle, bright white light at night. Very much improved night time vision. I haven't experienced any oncoming traffic flashing their lights telling me to dim them (When I am driving with dim lights on). I was getting an oil change so had my local garage mechanic install them for me. A panel inside the forward wheel wells have to be opened to gain access to the headlamp assembly, It took my local guy about 15min to install while the truck was up on the lift. You might want to do it yourself. See the instructions in the F-150 User Manual. I bought these also because many LED bulbs have a heat sink and fan on the back of the bulb and these only have a heat sink. Watch the videos."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装"," I got the set with low and high beams with chipset for both so I have no error on the dash, and no flickering. the road is so well lit at night now without the high beams, but not bright enough that they blind oncoming traffic. They have a slight blue color to them which looks great on my truck. It gives it such a ""clean"" look compared to the halogen. To install them is easy on the drivers side of my 2017 suburban because nothing is in the way. Took about 5-10 minutes to swap the bulbs. The passenger side was a little longer to do. The air filter box is in the way to access the lights, so you have to remove the box first. They lock in very easily and there is enough room that the chipset fits inside under the bulb itself for both low and high beam. And with the smaller end (heat sink), I was able to get the covers back over the bulbs with no problem. I'm very happy with this purchase, best upgrade if you have a suburban with the halogen bulbs. These LEDs have a very crisp, sharp light at night. And it even looks great during the day, like I said, ""cleaner"". the halogen just looks dingy, to yellowish and doesn't give enough light to see at night. Excellent product. Now I just hope they last long. They do come on as the daytime running lights would, so we will see how long they actually last me. But right now, I am very happy. I hope the pictures and video helps guys"

Installing these on a 2020 f150 is a pain but worth it as the halogens are trash. Kind of pathetic that a $70k truck comes with halogens but I digress. When you install these be sure the leds are in the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock position when they are in the final position. The DRL do not work with my truck so be aware of that but it's not a huge deal to me. I reached out to sealight support to see if there is a work around and they said there isn't but ended up refunding me. Excellent customer service and a good product for the money. Understand that you are paying $70 or something for leds. These aren't super premium but even as a budget pick they work very well and look great. So far no oncoming traffic has flashed me. Just install them correctly and you should not have that issue either. I highly recommend these leds and company. Also to other f150 owners, yes these do fit in the dust cover."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","I got these for my wife's Nissan Altima that has a headlamp housing recall because they lose reflectivity and grow dim over time. Yes, I will get around to fixing the housing, but I also wanted to get rid of the incandescent bulbs that came OEM.  Since both the low and high beams on that car are the same style, I just ordered four of these bulbs to replace them all. The low beams are noticeably brighter than the previous incandescent bulbs so that is good. However, the high beams are unbelievably better and brighter with these LEDs in place. I was always wanting ""more"" in high beam performance out of her car and these LEDs deliver.  So now, the car has a more modern lighting profile from the front, and the light being cast is better and brighter. I really like these bulbs. And being as easy to install as they were, anyone can do this upgrade."

Included were a booklet with instructions, trouble shooting, and FAQ’s written in coherent English. It also included some knit gloves for handling the bulbs and not getting oils from your hands on them. The whole kit was pretty impressive. The quality of the led’s, heat sinks and drivers seems great. It’s all one piece with only one connector marked with polarity (+ and -) so there is less chance for failure or water ingress. What really struck me is the focusing of the light. It’s GREAT with no sharp lines or hot spots. Anyone can make bright looking bulbs but getting the focusing correct is more difficult. I installed these on a Chevy Colorado, they went in easy with no errors or canbus issues and I was even able to reinstall the factory dust covers over the led heat sink and drivers. I’ll update on their continued performance and longevity but so far I’d call them a great buy"

We were noticing the nice LED lights on newer vehicles. [Our son had tried new LED lamps on his Ford 150 truck, but they seemed to need fan units to keep them cool.] Instead, I purchased these SEALIGHT SCOPARC LED BULBS on Amazon. The risk was worth it, AND we are very pleased. My wife drove the van first at night, and she was elated. I took it for a spin just to see for myself. Fantastic! Notables: 1-The instructions are well written. 2-They don't suffer the broken English that some product instructions have. 3-I meticulously followed the instructions in using the gloves & didn't allow the LED-posts to touch my hands or any dirt. 4-LOOK CLOSELY at the 2 side of the PLUGS. I treated the STAMPED + / - SIDE as the PLUG UP-side, since they can be plugged either way. It worked great the first time & did not fail or flicker. No dash idiot lights came on. I used the included wire zip ties to loosely loop the wires back away from the base of LED lights. They are said to get very hot. I highly recommend this product & company. They came quickly & work just as promised. THE ROAD LOOKS NICE & CRISP AT NIGHT. Also the LED lights seem to reflect off road signs more effectively."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","At least it's not a Malibu. There are a few videos showing the installation of these bulbs and some just show the rear cover being removed and the bulbs being installed. In reality you have to take the headlamp housing off in order to mount the voltage (I will call it a voltage transformer) block with the 2-sided tape to the inside of the assembly unless you are using orthoscopic surgery. This entails removing the top cover, grill and valance below the grill to remove the assembly then it's easy. The other issue is they project light differently than the original bulbs, so I was thinking re-aiming the light might be necessary. Maybe even a lens cover that limited the light going up. My wife's car has lights with a shutter that open when you use the high beams, they also move with the direction of the car. I have been getting a lot of high beam flashes even though the color of the light is white it does not seem overly bright."

These were priced right and got great reviews. I picked them up and they were certainly easy to install in my Jeep. However, Jeep is known to be very finicky. This created minor issues for me because LED lights require a constant energy source. Jeep provides intermittent power to lights by strobing the power rather than by a constant flow of electricity. LED lights will flicker or flash when this happens. Well, Sealight to the rescue with resistor cables that solved the problem. Also very easy to install.

However, these LEDs went in easily and make an amazing improvement over the factory halogens. No dark spots in the beam pattern either unlike other LEDs we've tried. This kit of both high and low beam bulbs was on sale, making it cheaper than a low beam only kit I bought before. That kit had to be sent back because 1 bulb stopped working after 3 cycles, and the other randomly stopped working/started working again the day we installed it.

These @ $15/each are a much more economical option. As for my brights, I don't feel they made much of a difference, but that's most likely because on my car when I turn on the brights - my regular headlights stay on as well. If it wasn't for this, I'm sure it would make a big noticeable difference. As for fit - I was concerned I wouldn't be able to fit everything in, but it all fit with no issues. Installation was a breeze - literally no more than 5 minutes total. The hardest part was realizing there was no real way of feeling/hearing the lights click into place...I think there's a rubber material and that prevents me from feeling it fit and click into place.

I will let you know to do the complete kit you have to take off the whole front bumper. There are youtube videos in case you need it.

Fitting is somewhat challenging on this vehicle, but no fault of the lights themselves, as they fit well, once you are able to get to the back of the reflector to install them. They are packaged well, and include cloth installation gloves, to keep finger oils off of the lights during installation. So far, these are performing flawlessly. I adjusted the low beams downward a bit (no adjustment possible on high beams), as the cutoff line is not as distinct on this type of bulb in a reflector enclosure, and while I have much more light shining down the road ahead of me, I have not been flashed by oncoming traffic, so I am confident that when properly adjusted, these are not going to blind oncoming traffic in normal conditions.

Install was pretty easy - access on the Equinox is via a cap in the wheelwell just for this purpose. Only challenge is getting all the extra components to fit under the dust covers on the back of each light. If you're not aware, LED bulbs tend to 1. have a larger area on the back with fins for heat dissipation and 2. an inline module to ensure the LEDs don't cause any issues with the vehicle's ECU.

Notice how much smaller the sealight is so modifying the dust cap won’t be necessary with these. And also with the JDM there was a shadow in the middle of each headlight but with the sealight no shadow. Had the JDM for 3 years. Let’s see how long the sealight lasts.

I will say Ford made changing the light bulbs a bit different than I’ve done on a vehicle but not hard really. Anyway onto these lights I wasn’t sure what to expect and well I was pleasantly surprised. The packaging was excellent and the lights feel like they are solid and well built , they give you extras that I didn’t need in my application but some may? Install was easy and they are 50x’s better than the stock F150 light bulbs. After I installed them I got back on Amazon and ordered the bulbs for the fog lights. These lights are great and really a great mod and cheap. Dollar for dollar best mod I’ve done on my truck. I’ll update if they go out prematurely."

These are truely a crisp white 6000K. Additionally the beam seem to provide a much better concentration of that white light with a wider dispersion than my stock lamps. This is one of the best investments I've made to my 2018 Ram 2500! The bulbs are expertly packaged with clear and COMLETE instructions pertinent to a general installation. Buy Them! Don H

I also have the 9006/9005 on my 2006 Duramax for the past 2 years. I love these lights!  I went with different brand on my Tacoma with regrets. Could not get the sea light brand at that time. I will not make that mistake next time.
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Unfortunately, this product wasn't compatible with my 2018 Subaru Forester but Sealight customer support went above and beyond when trying to make it work. The problem was with my high beam lights always being turned on after replacing the halogen with LED bulbs. The only way to turn my high beam lights off was turning off the engine. At no cost, they sent me canbus resistors to fix the issue but it didn't help. Eventually, they offered me a full refund. The lights were super bright, the installation was supper easy and I'm pretty sure that if didn't experience the compatibility issue I'd be very happy with these bulbs. Given all the support I've received with this product I've decided to give them 5 stars."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",These lights are very bright and look a lot better than the halogen OEM lights that were in my truck. The installation was more painful than it had to be (but not Sealights fault). I installed these in my 2020 F150. The passenger hi beam light that I had to remove from my truck was stuck and could hardly be removed. After struggling with it for a while I got someone else to give it a try and with some effort it came out. All of the light bulbs installed quite easily and really like them. I would recommend you give them a try.

Easy to install (once you have light housing off car) plug and play for my ‘18 Ram 1500. Says polarization not required but I used voltmeter to check my polarity and plugged accordingly. They ARE bright, compared to factory bulbs."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Great product. As  Well packaged, arrived quickly, easy install. Literally, plug and play. Hardest part was accessing the lights on my F150 - but a YouTube video helped a ton. Once you gain access, it’s as simple as inserting the replacement bulb, twisting it and tucking in the wiring. No adjustment of the light housing required. These shine where your old stock light shined. No issues from incoming drivers with the lights being too bright. I highly recommend these lights."

Not an issue with the product, but the tab slots on my 2008 Toyota Sequoia did not align well for a proper 3 and 9 o’clock position when installed. Had to back the main lights in behind a panel before I was able to fit the front in the assembly. Little tricky, but it worked out. Lights work great and are bright. Will see how the durability is."

I’ve tried other brands just to give them a shot but I always have ended up refunding them. I’m probably done experimenting with brands. Been working on cars for 20+ years. I’ve seen things come and go, but I hope this brand sticks around. Work every time, my last pair lasted for almost three years before I traded the car in. But this time will be a real test. Got a new family car, gonna have it for quite a long time. Let’s see how long these last, but overall. Great product, you can’t be disappointed."

I've never been satisfied with the halogens and I'm looking forward to being able to see at night now. These were easy to install and I appreciate the fact that they came with gloves. Well packaged and protected. I cannot speak about the longevity yet. I'll be back on that after a year or 3. If getting proctor headlamp housing was within my budget, I would have done that but they aren't for now so these LEDs will help. Hope not to blind anyone but just don't look at my lights then. 😉"

Sticking my hand down in their and twisting was a fight. No resistor/canbus needed, clean color and no error or flickers. Hand to adjust the angle of course but my truck is a 2500, lower profile vehicles will have to deal with it. Survived three rain storms so far, if you like the low beams? The high beams are ten times better👍🏼 ."

I turned my tires outward removed 3 screws and a plastic fastener (twist and pull to remove) then I used a short piece of wire to hold back the wheelwell Protector shield. Started with the main running lite removing rubber headlight seal. Twist lamp counter clockwise to remove. Use small head straight screwdriver to release lamp from power connector. Install new Led lamp tucking wires in light assembly. Replace rubber dust protector. Repeat process! I will UPDATE if Quality is Less then expected!
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Had one burn out at about 8 months, and they replaced it quickly. This is the 3rd brand I have tried, and by far the best. The way they are designed when installed, they light up low, and side to side. Work great for seeing down the road, but not having oncoming traffic flash the lights when on low beam. None of the others seam to have this, and they still light up the road very well. Also this is a Chevy 1 ton Diesel, and from rough roads and vibration seems to go through low beams every 6 months, not these. They have already outlasted the all the others. Make seeing deer on the back roads with plenty of time to slow down. Great product. When it's time for new ones, it will definitely be with these. Also high beams are 50% brighter than my old ones."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Installed on my 2006 Toyota 4 Runner SR5, job done in minutes. Low and high beams are different in size and plug connection, there's no way you can mistake them. Never touch the bulbs with bare finger !!! Use the included work gloves and avoid the bulbs to touch dirty areas when install. This was definitely a mayor upgrade to my car headlights, can't wait to try them on the road."

It became apparent that our cars were lacking in the headlight and high beams department. My husband leaves for work very early (4:45am) and I've been worrying about him with the headlights he has. These are so bright!! My husband says they were easy to change. I'm so relieved he can see better. We have a 2016 Dodge Ram. I just bought a second set for my 2015 Toyota Sienna.
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","I purchased this for my 2013 Toyota Highlander. I installed the H11 for the low beam, and H3 for the high beam. I made sure I was installing the correct lights as each light had a label on them. The installation was so easy, I was able to get it all done in less than 10 minutes. Time will tell if these will last long, but so far, they are very bright, much brighter than the bulbs that came with the car."

I did have to adjust them down because they were blinding other drivers, but other than that been running them for several weeks now without an issue. Will update if I have any problems."

I installed them in a 2007 Cadillac STS with projectors and the cut off line is crisp so they dont blind people. Objectively they are much brighter than the stock halogen bulbs and give the car more of a modern look. I had a small fitment issue with the high beam bulbs and my headlight housings but Kevin form the customer support team got me taken care of quickly. You can't go wrong with these"
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",Love bulbs will have to say a lot more work to replace a 2015 f150 then I thought would buy all 4 bulbs for each side of your truck before installing. If you have to replace any one of them you still have to go through same process. After watching videos on YouTube over and over again the 2nd bulbs took less than half as long. 45 minutes a side with no power tools. Absolutely love the difference couldn’t see with old bulbs.
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Purchased these for a 2005 Volvo s40. Bulbs seem to be well made. Installation was a breeze however, I did get the ""low beam failure"" alarm from the computer. Called the Sealight customer service phone number. Did not get a response via voice. However, within an hour, I received a text from Sealight. After explaining what my car was doing, they told me I needed the resistor kit and sent them to me for FREE. That's right, FREE. Resistor kit installation was also very easy (I used a multimeter to ensure positive and negative for my headlights BEFORE installing the resistors) and I followed the directions. Started up the car and the low beam failure alarm went away. Some people have mentioned that Sealight is not that great for customer service but that was not my experience at all. It wasn't instant service, but since we are 3000 miles apart, the service was pretty good."

I installed mine on a Ford F150, the easiest access is through the wheel wells. You’ll need a 7/32 socket or wrench which is tiny. The rubber boots are a little tough to remove from each socket. Total install time was around 45 minutes. The headlights went from a yellowish light to a bright white. I’m excited to see how they look at night. The bulbs seem very well constructed. One last thing, be careful when handling the bulbs. Don’t touch the LED"
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",I ordered this set based on the information they have. I ordered the set that “fits my truck” and it came with 2 HB3 and 2 H11 bulbs. After I finally had time to do the install turns out my truck actually takes 4 HB3 bulbs. I was only able to install 2 of the 4. The ones I installed were loose even after being “locked” in place. My return window is closed so I’m stuck with lights that A don’t fit well and B I can only use half of. Advantage to buying local. Lesson learned.
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Replaced halogen headlights and fog lights in two cars with Sealight LED lights. So far the LED lights work perfectly in both cars. The light output is much brighter than halogens, and of course look better color wise. They do light up the road better overall, but seems like the focused light pattern from the housing is different. Its not horrible, just doesn't seem to light up the road directly in front of the car the same. I have read this is common for LED replacement lights because the LED vs halogen bulbs emit light differently. For the price, quality, and increase in light output, highly recommend!"
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","So far I'm happy with it, i got same brand high/lowbeam and fog bulbs. I don't even turn on fogs anymore because there is no need and it's lets intimidating for oncoming traffic. I used to regret not getting LED light package on my truck and thought about getting the whole kit but now im glad i got these LED bulbs. The photo has the led lowbeam and regular fogs just to show the difference (i forgot to tk pic with before and after headlights)but i did change the fogs later."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",Arguably the brightest LEDs I’ve purchased. I installed these on my new 2020 Honda Civic Hatchback and these confused me at first. These are non-adjustable and I thought I had to align them but I was wrong. I simply locked them in place and they look like they’ve been aligned professionally! Super happy with these especially since I can see at longer distances. Highly recommend.
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",I purchased them from this online and I gave it to my grandpa as gift for his truck. Then I installed it but it little hard part of is disassemble the truck’s grille and bumper and unscrew everything out of this front grille and headlight parts for installation of new bulbs. Then it works very well and he now can see in the dark when he drives his truck. He said he really love it!
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",These were easy to install...watch a video on youtube. went right in. took me 15 mins for both. I didnt not install the high beam.( comes with it). they work great but they ARE NOT blinding. i was worried about that. Installed on my 2022 silverado trail boss. they actually seems proper but tame. im impressed. i will update if I have any issues. great price. these are made solid. Plug and play
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",Literally Plug And Play They Worked Perfect In The Stock Housing With Slight Adjustment Down To Not Blind Any On Coming Traffic.

I reserve the right to update at a future date if needed for any performance issues. I hope not to!"
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","So, I actually modified my headlights with a dremel, it literally took 30 min and they fitted hassle free, so from 3 stars it went up to 5 stars, it was not hard at all and honestly these lights are amazing quality and brightness, RECOMMENDED  My original review was: VOIDED< I WAS WRONG.  bought for a volvo c30, as advertised they would fit, the H11 perfect, the HB3 did fit the connector but the light beam;s Heat Sink does not allow for the bulb to slide in and so you need to modify or trim plastic pieces on the inside, THAT IS NOOOOOO GOOOOOD, and so, I love the beams, excellent quality however you gotta be very careful, check your beams on the inside before purchasing, see if you have ample space inside that beam, ligth color is fantastic, just superior to any normal light bulb."
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Very bright BUT there is one caution - polarity. When used in the Chevy 2107 Chevy 3500HD, and presumably in similar versions, the polarity of the connector for both the high beam and the low beam needs to be checked. The new bulbs have +/- marked on them, so a simple voltmeter test to find which pin is positive on the vehicle connector solves that issue. The set comes with lots of double stick pads and zip ties that aren't needed, just stuff the long leads and external module into the hole before you put the big cap back on. There's no need to unscrew anything around the air filter housing, except the hose clamp, disconnect some things and then PULL UP! Check the online videos. Special note: If you disconnect the big connector between the two beams in order to improve access, then NEITHER BULB will light."

"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",We put these in my son’s 2018 F-150 truck. The difference in brightness was night and day. We’ll probably do the fog lights next! This is the second vehicle in our household we’ve successfully installed these lights with no issues. The truck did require some mechanical skills to drop the inner fender skirt to get room to access the lights. No issue for a weekend mechanic.

I had a hard time seeing at night because my old ones were burned out. It was like driving with no lights on at all but now even in ten day I can see they are bright. Thanks for the great lights and the easy installation. I had a friend install it and it took him about 40min for all four lights.

Boy, am I glad we did! what a difference!! I was worried that I might be an annoyance to other drivers with these lights, but no bad gestures yet!

These look very well made and are packaged extremely well. They even come with gloves for installation. Tonight will be the ultimate test but even in the garage I could see a change in the brightness when I tested them. I wish I had done this a year ago.

Nice and crisp, and looks so much better on the truck than the halogens Chevy put on this truck. The low beams are easily to install, the high beams are tougher just because the channel to reach down is very small. Took me about 30 minutes to install both.

Install was simply a matter of replacing the stock halogen bulbs with the LED bulbs. Ford makes accessing the back of the headlight housing a little challenging on a 2020 F-150 but the install only took about 30 minutes. I don’t know about the longevity of these bulbs yet.

I’ve ran PIAA bulbs for the last 15+ years and these perform much better. Greatly quality, packaging, no shortcuts taken. Will purchase for future vehicles.

"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装",Installed these in a 2014 Grand Cherokee. Perfect fit. Even came with work gloves to wear during the install. Whiter than original halogens and illuminates the road a bit further ahead but light distribution is less even than with the halogens (not unexpected). Selected these because they do not need a cooling fan and because they are not so bright as to blind oncoming drivers on low. About as bright on low as the factory LEDs on my 2019 VW.
"SEALIGHT 9005/HB3 H11/H9/H8 LED 灯泡组合,超亮冷白色,即插即用,4 件装","Replaced the high, low, and fog light (different product). A little tight to get the bulbs but the product itself clicks into place easily. Far better and SAFER than stock in terms of night-time and rain visibility. Note for 2015 CX5s, after the installation of high beams, the daytime running light is out. Can’t comment on longevity but relying on LEDs reputation for lamp life."

But this TruActive mount is awesome! It's super easy to install (no tools required), easy to adjust and holds my big phone with no drama. I rode my bike a few miles over pavement, grass, gravel and dirt (with rocks), off of curbs, etc. and not a single movement or adjustment. The rubber gripping tool keeps my phone super sturdy and in easy reach.  Now I can pull over to answer texts or get directions with no drama."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I had a prior cell phone mount that I never felt comfortable with - the mount didn't stay in one position and only the elastic bands held the phone on the mount. This Truactive holder has the elastic band and a grip that goes around both sides of the phone. The phone stays in one position. One corner of the elastic band rarely slips off the phone (like the prior holder), but the side grips still holds it securely in place (unlike the other holder). I feel completely comfortable going down fast bumpy downhills with my new iPhone in the holder. Its nice to have an easy to install, and easy to use, phone mount that I don't have to worry about. It is holding up well despite regular use. I would recommend this mount without reservation."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装",So I ordered this for my Harley Davidson 883 and I have to say that it really is a great phone holder! I was on my way to work at 5 am on my motorcycle and hit a deer. Bike went one way I went the other. I got up and went straight for my bike and my phone was still attached to the holder!!

This product fit it perfectly and passed speed bumps, potholes, and abrupt stops check. The phone stayed stable without having to readjust. And switching it from bike to bike is simple too. It doesn't obstruct any of the buttons or screen so we have full pokemon go access."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","We bought two of these, one for each of our bikes. They work perfectly. The adjust to our phones. We take our phones out of our protective cases to put them in (which I never do), but they snug in so tight, that I feel safe enough doing it. The black holder squeezes tight around the phone to hold it and then the rubber ends pull up around each corner to secure it. We have been on rough terrain and the phone doesn't move at all. We have hands free, bluetooth helmets, and mileage trackers on our phones, so it is nice to have the phone right there on the handlebar to see what is going on. LOVE THESE HOLDERS! And what a great price!"
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","Update: The seller reached out to me which I was surprised about and was very nice and understanding regarding my review. They offer to send me a replacement. The new one is very stiff and now keeps my phone still and secure. I also notice the knob that secure the mount is a lot more fluid which makes it easier to loosen and tighten. The retractable clips on the sides works a lot better too where as before when I press the button, it would detract very much. Overall I am very satisfied with the replacement and I give props to their customer service to resolving this issue without me even reaching out to them.  Works well when riding on smooth pavement. On bumpy terrain like uneven pavement, dirt paths and gravel, the ball joint always shift no matter how much I tighten it. It does a great job keeping my phone secured but it gets frustrating having to adjust my phone every time I go over a couple of bumps."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I got this holder mount for my Samsung s7, which is quite big and heavy and it is holds it so well -no shaking at all ! rubbers attached to my phone hold it so well!! All other products I had in the past for holding my phone (in the car or bike) were unstable, shaky and made me reluctant to use my phone for navigation on my bike- so I never navigated! Now I can bike as much as I want anywhere I want, because I can have my phone securely fastened! I can navigate with google maps around Seattle! Really good value for the money - highly recommend it ! I am going to use my bike more thanks to this holder as I am no longer worried about my phone dropping. Thank you TruActive for attaching several different colors bands too!"
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I finally got tired of my phone jumping out of my pockets when riding my bike, so I went looking for a mount that would be suitable and came across this product when searching across Amazon. I've used it a few times now and I have to say, it does exactly what it should do and does it pretty well.  It's easy to attach to your handle bars and comes with a few different color options for the bands that hold your phone in place. I was a little wary of these bands, as I was worried the phone would wobble a bit, but turns out, there's not much to worry about. Once the phone is in place, particularly since I have a a rubberized case on it, it does not move. The only issue I ran into is related to where the volume buttons are on my phone. I had to be careful with the placement of the bands to avoid them pushing against either of the buttons, but that was a minor issue that was easy to get around.  And if you're wondering if it'll hold a larger phone, I have a Samsung S21+ and the bands were plenty stretchy enough to secure the phone. Simply put, once I got the bands in place, the phone wasn't going anywhere and held steady despite all of the speed bumps present in my apartment complex. The first ride saw the whole mount slowly drop, causing the phone to tilt a bit, but tightening it up solved that.  Overall, I'm plenty happy with it and confident my phone isn't going to go on a magical flying voyage while I ride my bike."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I have two of these. One for my motorcycle and another for my road bicycle. I'm buying another for my touring bicycle as well. The one on my motorcycle has been on it for several years and has never given me any problem. The bike is stored indoors and is not heavily used so that's probably why the original elastic band is still on it. Those do break after a certain amount of sun exposure, but they give you many extras so you can just pop another one on there. One of those broke on my road bike after about 8 months of use but I just put another on and kept going. Installation couldn't be simpler. It just clamps to the handlebars and the part that holds the phone has a big plastic nut on the bottom side that locks it to a pivoting ball. You can leave the nut loose enough to move your phone around to different angles if you want, but if you expect to use it where it will be jarred often, you might want to pick a favorite position and then lock that nut down fairly tight. It won't move if you do that. But don't tighten it so tight that the nut breaks. Hand tighten only. It is plastic, after all. Great buy!!"
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","Updated Review: I thought that this didn't fit my iphone and that was because I didn't realized that there is a button on the side of the side of the holder that lets you adjust the side arms. So inconclusion if you are not an idiot like myself then this will probably work great for you. Its easy to install and my phone feels secure while riding. Also, the customer service was great and super responsive, all of my issues were 100% user error.  Original Review: I bought a similar one for my wife’s bike and thought I was buying the type again with other colors and it was a mistake. This thing is almost impossible to use with my iPhone 12 Pro. The arms on the side are too tight and getting my phone in and out is a hassle."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","Pretty good, but the mechanism holding the phone will not stay positioned if I go over a rough patch of road, or even when crossing an expansion joint on a paved surface if the joint crack is more than 1.5 inches wide. The adjustment mechanism is tightened to the max, and I’ll still have to realign the phone after a small amount of shaking. UPDATE; The seller replaced the unit and it works perfectly. It was tested on a road bike over a few washboarded roads during a week long cycling tour, and my iphone 12 pro max remianed in position without needing adjustment."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I bought this as an Amazon Warehouse product and the twist-on nut was missing. I reached out to the manufacturer to see about a replacement and never received a reply. I made due with a regular nut, but it requires a tool and regular checks to make sure it is secure. Add to it that installing on a mountain bike requires the (included) rubber strip, I found the mounting bracket overall to be difficult and cumbersome. Not eager to take it off, so hope it stays attached when I travel with the bike. It performs pretty well otherwise, just be careful of where the side brackets close near the power button on most Android phones UPDATE 10/21- After seeing my review, the company reached out to me via Amazon and asked to make it right. They offered me a full replacement - not just the missing piece. I asked them to send just the screw on nut because I didn't write the review angling for another item. Regardless, they insisted and sent me a free replacement with extra nuts, so now I have two complete sets. My wife immediately claimed the replacement as she was impressed by the original. It really does a fantastic job of holding over rough terrain and stays in place when riding on the rack on the back of my vehicle. Lots of credit to Jenny and the team for finding me and going the extra mile to make sure I got the fullest use of the product and am (now) a happy customer. I highly recommend this product and company."

Many other holders do not stay put or move slightly while using - not this one. I appreciate that the holder comes with a variety of colored bands, two different lengths of bolts so even thick handlebars are not an issue. If you're looking for a sturdy, well made holder, you found it."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I have been able to easily move this between my road bike, mountain bike and motorcycle. It comes with rubber mounting adaptors which allow for secure installation regardless of handlebar circumference. The only drawback has been that it does not allow for much angling to the sides, so if you're using your camera, you can mostly only mount it in a way that you can see what's in front of you. That said, for the price, you can't beat it. And it showed up on schedule and as described. Would recommend."

I needed a phone holder that would secure my phone during the worst of conditions and falls. I have tried several, and the Tru Active Bike Phone holder is hands down the best product to secure your phone. This phone holder attaches to any size handle bar securely and safely. It is designed for all phones, and I can attach my headphones directly through the bottom of the holder for hands free listening and comfort. The product comes with several colored stretch bands to lock down your phone even more securely. Pick the one that matches your bikes color venue. Takes only seconds to attach or remove your phone. I have purchased 3 over the years, and it looks good on all three of my different bike styles. It is very well made with high quality materials and you can adjust the holder to keep the phone at great eye level while biking. This is a well designed and easy to use product. I use it on every single ride. Don't hesitate, buy one now, you won't be disspointed."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I wanted to keep this item SO BAD. Like I really, really like this. I put my phone into the mount and shook it around and my phone didn’t move at all. It is absolutely perfect. But only in that sense. I put it on my road bike and my handlebar is way too thick for this. I didn’t have any screw left. I tried it on my boyfriend’s mountain bike and it fit perfectly. His handlebars are super thin so it was the perfect match. Only, my boyfriend does not see the need for having his phone attached to his bike. I can’t keep this. He doesn’t want it. And I can’t use it. I really wish it fit. But seriously, after wrapping it around my handlebar there was little to no screw left. The black part to attached couldn’t get on it at all. I’m really sad about this. If anyone knows of a device like this that fits around thick road bike handlebars let me know."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","It really is a bicycle mount for your phone. I tried it attached to a R1200GSA and it mounts swell on the handle bar but the weight of my phone eventually tilts it downward. Trying to tighten the mount is impossible while riding, since the knob to do so is on the back of the phone holder. There is no fault with the phone mount, it just doesn't have a sturdy enough hardware to keep a phone at the right angle for any long trip. I rode on pavement for an hour and a half, and didn't even attempt a ride off road. Other than that, it is well made, comes with additional replacement elastic bands in case you should loose one, and the customer contact is exceptional."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I bought this for my husband and like it so much, I came back and bought myself one. We have them on our bikes and while usually we are enjoying the views, sometimes you want to be able to see the phone. The plastic seems to hold it well enough but the rubber thing really gives it that extra security. That think is going nowhere! One thing, if you have a pop socket on your phone, its a bit tricky, as all cradles are with those. I put two of the rubber things on so it one holds the bottom and one the top, that was my work around since I like my pop socket. They give you plenty of them so why not? I cant imagine they would ever break, they are super strong, I saw need to conserve them."

I use two of them and stretch each corner loop to wrap around my entire phone.. my phone is in a case and has a pop socket on it. I will update with photos.. I highly recommend this for anyone who ride rough terrain. And, I would definitely recommend wrapping the bands around your phone however you'd like to ensure your devices safety."

This holder attached easily to the handlebar, and so far, after several months of regular use, has not needed tightening. It has accommodated both an iPhone 7 and a 13. The combination of side gripping mechanism, fold-out bottom shelf, and silicon stretch bands provides redundancy and peace of mind that my phone is securely fastened to my bike. Both my spouse and I leave the holders on the bikes when transporting the bikes on our car - they have not come loose. They are well designed and reasonably priced."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","This is good. It clamps firm to the handlebars without sliding around, and hold the phone firmly. I've not always had good luck with some handlebar accessories for this reason, but this is a good one. It feels solid, like it won't break if I am careless or In a rush and crank a bolt too tight. The phone stays put, even if I accidentally hit it with my hand while riding, or if there's a lot of wind or bumps in the path. The silicone strap does not peel or strip or anything, just stretches to hold and goes back to normal when its released. There are extra and they are very light and dont take up much space at all. Can't really ask for more. I feel like this will last at least a few years under the ridiculous conditions I put it through. I dont have a ton of time to write reviews, but I did come here to put in the good word because I'm glad to have something I trust holding my lifeline, as it does."

When I changed phones I needed a better phone holder because the fingerprint unlocking was on the rear of the phone. This clamped onto my cart handle securely, and held my phone at a readable angle. it seems robust enough to hold up to the cart being folded and tossed from car to garage to golf course. Nice product. A minor touch that would make this a more usable phone holder: make it more easily and faster to remove/install in order to switch from my hand cart to a driving cart (for when a golf cart does not have built in GPS) or to a bicycle."

Even when i installed phone in clamp, I forgot to put bands on, and never lost the phone. I can see the bands are a wear item, but with the extra band, I have no worries. I just finished riding for this season on East Coast and had ZERO PROBLEMS. I would recommend this holder over any of the ""fancy ones"" out there."

I bike around 4 miles a day 5 to 6 times a week for work, while I'm not hitting any trails it holds strong.

I'm actually surprised it's been able to stand up to the shaking, not because it's a cheap product, but because the terrain is so root-y and technical where I ride (Pig Trail, Macon GA). I love that they included multiple rubber holsters with the kit.  I'm actually glad it's plastic though. I've crashed a few times and the mount swivel gave when I rammed it with my legs. If it were made of metal and didn't move at all I'm sure I'd have a bruise or gash on my leg from hitting it. Something you don't really think about when making a purchase like this."

To start I have a note 10 plus so it will hold a large phone . What I love about it is how securely holds the phone. It also comes with several different straps to secure the phone in different colors. The phone will not fall off no matter how rough of a road or off road you ride. If you tighten it up enough it won't even move which makes it great for riding and catching Pokémon or using your GPS.

With all the vibration by bars have, it does not slip and holds my phone tight. If you have a larger cell phone however (I have a Galaxy A11 which is fairly large), the adjustable side braces barely closes on it fully, but the elastic piece that wraps around the corners really holds it tight in place. Was a little insecure about getting on the highway at first, hoping my phone wouldn't jar loose and fall off, but it holds solid. You also get 2 size screw for wider or thinner bars, so it really would work well on any motorcycle or bike. Happy with mine!"

"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I bought a pair of these for my wife's and my e-bikes. They mount very easy and are VERY sturdy. I routinely hit some hard bumps at higher speed than a traditional bike would, and the phone stays put. My neighbor spent more for a different holder and when he saw mine, he threw his away and bought these as well. I trust this mount to hold my large Samsung phone and not drop it."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装","I had been looking for a reliable phone holder for as long as I've had my motorcycle (which had been several years). The bike is a Harley, and a Dyna so the vibration from both the motor and the Oregon backroads had proven too much for several other more expensive brands. I finally found the TruActive holder after almost losing yet ANOTHER phone to the unforgiving asphalt gods. It's well constructed, easily attached, has an unassuming profile and the colorful rubber holders are where the magic happens. They fit any phone size, hang on to any style of case and simply DO NOT BREAK. I've used my TruActive holder for over a year now. It's held up to over 5,000 miles of rides, rain, cold, heat, wind and several rather wild bike rallies. I remain confident in it's performance and in the fact that my phone can go everywhere I need it to, but won't go ANYWHERE it shouldn't."
"TruActive 高级自行车手机支架,摩托车手机支架,6 色带,自行车手机支架 - 通用任何手机或车把,自行车手机支架,ATV - 免工具安装",I bought this for a friend in a power wheelchair who needed easy and stable access to her cell phone. We had to add a little extra inside the clamp because the bar she had was too small but it’s works perfectly! She is able to operate her phone without having to lean over or look down at it which helps her maintain better posture! Great product and just what we needed! (Even her wheelchair vendor was impressed)

It was very easy to install and is very adaptable for handle bar diameters. It is easy to adjust for viewing angle and easily fits my phone.

The only thing i think you guys need to work on are the teeth that grab the phone when you push both sides closed. As you know many people have cases on their phones mainly otter box cases and the fit great but those inner teeth get all bent up after a week of riding my teeh are all bent up and they are not grabing the phone like when i firt pit the holder on the bike. I ride a 2008 Yamaha FZ1. And at high speeds i was confident in the holder. No doubt its good but those inner teeth need a better design because they bend up to easy. Other than that its a great holder for sure. I have told many people about it and they like it. I would definitely continue to be a customer. I would just like to see those teeth more durable for phone cases.

I have had two in the past that were ultra flimsy and I didn't trust them at all. I attached this to my bicycle and went off path into the woods and the holder did AMAZING! There is NO WAY the phone was going anywhere in this contraption. I would highly recommend it for a bicycle or motorcycle. I used to ride motorcycles in the past and I would have no problem trusting the holder on that as well. The price point is spot on.

It is very sturdy and fit my iPhone 12 max pro with case that has a loop on the back. It allowed me to take photos and videos while riding my bike and it came out smooth and clear. Now I use it on the bar of my exercise trampoline to watch videos or listen to music while I’m jumping. I like that it holds my large phone in its bulky case and that it also comes with different color bands to go around the phone. It was easy to use right out of the box. Great product!

I didn't want to transfer a phone holder from another bike so I bought this one based on the product description and good reviews. Very simple installation. It holds the phone more stable than others we have. We put the first one my wife's bike and she has used it a couple dozen times. We both think it is superior to the others we bought at the bike store for more $$.

It is easy to install with two bolt options depending on bar thickness. The mount is adjustable and once tightened, will remained fixed. It is great to hold flat items such as phones. It does not hold a handheld Garmin GPS (Oregon) although I do not take away stars because that is not it's intended purpose and Garmin has it's own mounting solutions. It was worth a try.

The holder design addresses so many potential issues that can arise for different bikes and each user. The holder is made from a fabulously rugged polymer and I love that TruActive provides so many back-up silicon grips and in so many colors. I have transferred the holder seamlessly between by road bike, mountain bike, and electric bike, despite the difference in handle bar diameter. Because TruActive's holder is so inexpensive compared to other phone mount holders, I an seriously consider purchasing another.

I leave the house at 5am so it’s dark out so the yellow pair are perfect for night driving, I had absolutely no wind leakage. No fogging either and I wear a half helmet and a leather face mask that usually channels my breath straight into my glasses. These had no issues whatsoever. A little big for my face but that’s not a manufactured issue, I just have a small face. I even dropped them at work while packing my locker and the bounce and all but didn’t break from a distance of about 4 feet. All in all a good deal for a small price."

I’d elaborate, but, why bother?  They say you get what you pay for; not with these. This is a $10 cash grab for a 75 cent trio of “glasses”. They’re amazingly awful- if you can afford to waste $10, order these, then ponder why the average rating is so high."

Overall build quality just felt cheap. I purchased these specifically to cycle in cold weather and not have foggy lenses. I immediately put them on indoors, and within seconds they fogged up. I tried the clear and the colors, all behaved the same. The 2 stars is because they do look the way they're pictured, and if you want some glasses that look like this and have some arguably useful foam padding (which didn't actually make a seal around my eyes, these are a cheap option."

I'm not sure if I'm going to get cancer from Chinese plastic, or if they will last very long, but upon first handling there is NOTHING about these that I can complain about. Especially for $12 for 3 different glasses. The fit is absolutely perfect, the construction feels as sturdy as any $200 Oakley's i've ever owned and they even came with a soft bag and cleaning cloth. My ONLY complaint - which is bogus when factoring in the cost - is that I would have preferred 3 smaller glasses bags instead of one large one to fit them all in. What a whiny thing to complain about. I'd give these 6 stars out of 5 when you factor in the cost. Do yourself a favor and if you are in the market for riding glasses, buy them. If you KNOW someone in the market, buy them for them."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I love to ride my bike to work but even sunglasses that wrap can let air in and annoy you on a long ride and cause eye irritation. each one of these sunglasses have small pads that remove the airflow so you can ride without any wind getting into your eyes. There was a night riding pair, day riding and clear pair for every scenario. Could not recommend these more."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","When it come and things for my motorcycle, I've found expensive ""cool looking"" glasses are not always the best when it comes to riding on the highway, they don't block the wind very well, drying out my contacts, or they are too lite and constantly bounce around on my face, sometimes even blocking my vision for a moment, Well these glasses aren't cool but they certainly block the wind and don't move at 75mph. The yellow lens actually does let in light. So for the price you get 3 shades for 3 different lighting conditions  Safe riding/travels"
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I usually have a hard time finding glasses that fit my head well and I am pleasantly surprised that these glasses are light but secure, don't pinch my temples and they don't stick to my face. They rest super comfortably around my eyes. The price was great. I like having all three colors of yellow, clear and shaded. The yellow is perfect for driving at night or driving in the rain so I can see more or any possible hazards and the clear and shaded pairs are perfect for working out in the yard especially during allergy season when I need to try to block out as much pollen as possible I'm getting into my eyes."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I was looking for some new bicycle glasses to ride my recumbent trike. They all looked very expensive and I was really looking for 2 pairs, clear for pre dawn and a dark pair for when the sun came up. Big bucks. When I found this set of 3 for $11 it was a eureka moment. They’re perfect, good quality, lightweight and comfortable. I use the light amber ones for riding in the dark, they’re perfect for first light and great for in the dark. Then I switch to the dark glasses when the sun comes up. What an awesome set!"
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I bought these for when I am riding my motorcycle. I tried them out on a poker run. They are comfortable to wear. It did a great job at keeping dust out of my eyes. My only complaint is that the lenses has popped out a few times on the amber glasses. (I always wear the amber glasses at night, even when I'm driving my car.) It wasn't anything major as the lenses were easy to pop back in."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",On a recent visit to the Philippines we noticed the lack of eye protection use. Motorized bikes and trikes are a primary method of transportation and having proper eye protection seemed to be an afterthought for those operating those machines. We purchased for our family members in the Philippines who operate and ride trikes/bikes on a daily basis. We've been told that they fit perfectly and provide much needed protection.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",I got these for my fiancé and they were nice quality and fit well. The different color lenses are great! He loves the yellow ones for riding his motorcycle at night. We use the clear ones as safety glasses when weed whacking. The padding on the inside is perfect. The price was excellent!
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","My husband loved these for riding. They are durable, good value & have lasted a lot longer than I expected.  I personally do not like these because they do not sit on my face correctly. Which is not the brands fault, more of my mothers fault for giving me a button nose & high cheek bones.  If you have a normal nose & face shape, these will be great for you 🙃"
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","These fit so well with my helmet. I have contacts and they used to dry out while riding with regular sunglasses. These have changed my riding. They continue to keep the wind out of my eyes. The night vision goggles are the best, my sight has improved so much while riding my bike."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I paid 20 dollars for one pair at the bike shop, and here I got 3 pair for less than half of that. The only difference I see in these is that the nose bridge isn't quite as thick as the ones I got at the bike shop. But I can't see that making any difference unless you go face first into the pavement, which hopefully will never happen. And the selection is perfect too. 1 dark tint - 1 yellow tint - 1 clear tint. The padding keeps out all the air too. Great glasses. You can't go wrong."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I had a pair of foam lined glasses, both for day and night (dark and yellow). The clear are an added bonus for cloudy days. This set of glasses are actually better, in practice, because they are vented (tiny gaps in the foam lining) which keeps them from fogging up. Add to that, all 3 cost the same as only one pair of the others. Finally the clear set was an added bonus I wouldn't have bought myself, but can double as safety glasses at the range."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I love these, granted I've only used them twice so far. I use them for cutting grass because when I am mowing, the grass blows in my face and eyes when I turn on a Zeroturn mower. I've tried normal sunglasses and safety glasses but I still get grass in my eyes. These haven't allowed any grass in my eyes except once. I'll take this over getting grass in my eyes 7-10 times each time I cut grass.  The durability might not be so great but just be careful and take care of them and you should be fine. Awesome price too!"
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","Wore the yellow and clear two tracking and shooting and they worked great. I did wear the yellow ones sea dooing and had to come back and get the sunglass version bc the glare on the water from the sun was way too vibrant while wearing the yellow, it made it difficult to see if there was a boat or fallen tubers in front of me. Night and day changing to the black shades where it cut down on the glare and made it easy to see."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",I'm really happy with this purchase. These are great glasses. Not a cool look like top gun but they stay put and don't flutter around when riding. That is the most important feature is the tight fit around the eye sockets. It keeps the air out of your eyes and they dont jump around in the wind like my other glasses.  The amber ones are actually blue blockers and sharpen the view in daytime or night.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",Have worn the smoke and clear ones with my half helmet. I though my vision would be restricted compared to my regular sunglasses that I wear with that helmet. Was not the case. They also do better with wind causing eyes to water. Seem to be a good choice for half helmet wear.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I bought these for my boyfriend for riding his motorcycle. He loves them so much. My son tried them and asked me to buy them for him. They are the least expensive that I could find and the best I could find. They work great, fit well and have the 3 different lenses for different uses. I highly recommend."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","No, these are not high end fancy glasses and they are not scratch resistant so you have to take care - BUT they really do the trick for keeping wind and debris out of your eyes while cycling or boating, etc. and you really can't beat the price"
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","Exceptional riding glasses for the money. Fit nice and close against face to prevent bugs and debris from entering. Lenses are optically correct and don't restrict or distort your field of vision at all, so you basically forget you have them on. Comfortable fit, yet they stay on securely. Carrying/storage bag is well made and attractive. Very good product."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","This was just what I needed after cataract surgery to keep out dust and wind out of sensitive eyes. The yellow night glasses work ok; it didn’t sharpen the glare of headlights but did dim them. The sunglasses are great for light sensitivity. They do seem to fog up sometimes but minimally. Good peripheral vision. I used in the car not on motorcycle, so can’t soeak to that. I did mow and paint fence with them and worked well for what I needed. Recommend you try if seeking these attributes"
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",Little tight on friends ears but I’m sure he is just sensitive and that you can’t please them all. I am sure the tightness is to keep glasses on head while riding at high speeds.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",This product is comfortable and doesn't readily fog up. It is great while mowing grass or riding my 4 wheeler for keeping dust out of my eyes.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I wear a small helmet. These fit snug. Love them for riding my ATV. I use the clear, yellow and sunglasses. I use the clear glasses at work for better protection in COVID patient isolation rooms."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",If you wear contact. which is why I got them. I recommend my contacts was drying out so bad with regular sun glasses. But not now. And can put the clear ones on at night.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","I bought these for eye protection from Covid. The foam around them seals to the skin. They are very comfortable to wear. My husband is on chemo so it is essential we take as many measures as we can to protect ourselves. Other than doctor/hospital, curbside trunk pick up we isolate at home."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",Very good quality frames with interchangeable lenses that have a sealing gasket around the eyes keeping dust and such out of them....mostly lol ' It only takes a few seconds to change from shades to clear or amber and carry on
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","They are just as advertised, great value for the price, keep dust out of my eyes as I use them for trail riding on my side by side. Keep dust from getting in my eyes and are comfortable as well. Worth the money and more."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",Glasses are awesome for the price and the yellow saved me at night driving in the rain. They help when cutting grass to keep the dirt out of my eyes. Love them.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",Bought these for me and they were not deep enough so my eyelashes hit the lens (I have long eyelashes) so I gave them to my boyfriend and he loves them. He says the yellow lens are great at night and they are comfortable. For the price definitely worth the purchase.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",They are well made but not expensive. I'm hard on sunglasses between work and motorcycling. This is the 2nd 3 pack Ive ordered in almost 3 years and these are way better than that version. Comfortable and fit well
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","These glasses are great. They are pretty comfortable to wear. I keep them in the sidebag of my motorcycle so that I have options for when I go out riding. They fit snug to my face but are padded so that they are comfortable to wear. I definitely recommend, especially if you are looking for an inexpensive option to have in your bag or need some spares."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",My husband really likes these. But he says the yellow pair for night driving enhances the bugs flying at him. Lol
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",These are great especially for the low price. Keep out the wind while riding and they’re comfortable. Love em. 5 stars
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",My dad was THRILLED with the way they fit snug but not tight and he used them BEFORE motorcycle season! The snow was killing his eyes w the reflection! Slipped on his new riding glasses and all was well !!!
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","So far so good. The amber lenses are perfect for the early morning commute in the dark. The foam padding keeps the wind from hitting my eyes and the glasses hold tight even at 80+ on the speedo. The glasses pinch my temples a little, but that should go away as they loosen up a little. Worth the price paid, even if they only last one winter season."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动","This was kind of a throw away purchase. at $6.00 i couldn't pass up the buy. If they didn't fit, i wasn't out much but i was pleasantly surprised at how well they fit. As a somewhat large guy with a largish head, these fit great. There was a small issue where the padding wasn't glued perfectly to the rim of the glasses and the glue was showing but not a show stopper. Fast shipping, and it came with a nice cinch bag."
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",I love these. The padded glasses fit very well and keep excess wind off my eyes. Wonderful value for the money.

"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",I’m tough on glasses therefore try not too spend too much money on them. I have been using these glasses for years and normally buy a set a year. I use the sunglasses and the clear ones quite a bit don’t normally use the yellow ones but have on very overcast days or as it’s getting to dusk time. Definitely recommend this product if three glasses.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",I wear these when I drive my RZR in the desert and in the mountains. They keep out the fust mud and rain. Because they have such a compact low profile they even fit perfectly under my helmet.
"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",These are great glasses for riding. The dark tint is perfectfor sunny days. The yellow is amazing for those cloudy or dusky times.

"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",Very comfortable for long term use like side by side or ATV riding. Foam around the lens keeps it from digging in to your face.

"3 副摩托车骑行眼镜衬垫护目镜防紫外线防尘防风摩托车太阳镜带透明烟黄色镜片,适合户外运动活动",They allow wind to get to your eyes which isn’t great at 60mph. But they’ll do for the price.

Security is key. I've owned several styles, the one previous to this one a RAM X mount. Plenty secure wth the rubber bands back up, but the clamps interferred with my volume buttons. Beyond that, the rubber bands are - let's face it - a pain. Along came the Lamicall phone holder, similar to others I've owned but far more substantial, far more elegant. Easy to slip the phone into the mount and then lock it. No rubber bands necessary for a secure hold. Rotates easily from protrait to landscape depending on one's direction of travel. It tilts so that the camera lenses are protected from bugs if you are on a naked or near naked bike - another big plus. I love the thing. Just bought second one for another motorcycle so I don't have to swap. Plenty big enough for an iPhone 12 Pro Max with protective case."

You DO NOT need to sand the ball to make the ring fit. Here is what I did. 1. Place the ring over the ball. 2. Push the ball into the socket. 3. Place the phone holder on a flat surface as in the 1st picture. 4. Position thumbs and fingers on ring as in 2nd picture. 5. Press down on ring. This will slightly compress the socket onto the ball. Be sure to hole the ring flat so you don't cross thread it. 6. Press down on the ring and rotate it clockwise at the same time. This will allow the threads of the ring and socket to engage. Once the thread of the ring engages the thread of the socket you will be able to finish tightening the ring onto the socket. Tighten the ring until you achieve the desired firmness of fit."

It just clamps down until it has grabbed the handlebar.  I did have a little trouble alighning the nut that holds the mount to the ball joint on the back. If I did not unscrew the retaining nut completely the ball joint would not pop into the socket. Ones the ball joint was in place is was difficult to the the nut started on its threads. Once it is assembled the design gives a lot of adjustment of the tightness of the ball joint.  There is a little lever on the back of the mount that is intended to lock your phone into the mount. It is very hard to open and close it. Fortunately the spring loaded clamping system holds the phone securely, for my purposes, without the need to close the lock. That might be different for mountain bikers , or people using it on motorcycles, but most of my cycling is on paved bike paths or streets.  One improvement, that I am thinking about trying to make myself, is the addition of magnets under the bottom half of the rubber pad that the phone rests against. I use magnetic phone mounts in a lot of places and it would be nice to have a little extra securing, for my phone, that magnets would provide."

The unit is engineered incorrectly. The ball must be installed into the socket then tightened to hold it together. Had I not owned a vice I would have never got the ball into the socket with the tightening nut applied. I’m sure the unit was designed to put the ball into the socket before threading the lock nut on; unfortunately, the lock nut could not be threaded once the socket was seated due to the threads being misaligned. I use this model on a Harley Electra Glide. The clamps around the phone even when locked allow the phone to slip in the top clamp. The unit shakes so much when the Harley is running that my Lifeproof case cracked. I am still in search for a suitable phone holder. Don’t buy it."

Just no good place to attach it at the handlebars, with a real risk of sticking a finger into the spokes should I need to tap the phone for some reason. But the 40mm clamp opening on the Lamicall holder attaches perfectly on the trike's boom, placing the phone front and center as I'm heading down the road.  And this is a robust mount. The phone clamp is gear activated, with a locking switch. Much better than stretching elastic bands to hold the four corners of the phone. Top marks here, this was exactly what I needed."

Overall this mount is very overbuilt for my purpose and will probably last as long or longer than the exercise bike. It is very secure and holds the phone very securely but not too difficult to get the phone out of when you need to.  But, my Samsung S21 ultra in the Urban Armor Gear case BARELY fits, I mean just barely squeaks by the edges to be able to get it in and out.

Also now for my Yamaha Raptor 660R ATV. I gave this one a try. I’ve only had it for a handful of rides, but I was riding very hard and the phone mount stayed in place. Even with all the bouncing around on rough trails, the mount didn’t move and the phone stayed put too. I’ve been primarily using it to use my phone for a GPS speedometer, but also used maps when trying to figure out where I was on the trails. I love the way it clamps. I love how secure the phone is in it. It does not appear to me to be cheap or flimsy at all. It’s very easy to place the phone in the mount and remove it, yet very secure in the way it holds the phone. The way the clamp operates leads me to believe I could clamp it to something other than handlebars if I wanted to. I liked it so much, I’ve ordered another one for my Rancher, and I might consider getting another one for my bicycle."

It didn't get in the way of my headphone jack at all, nor would it interfere with a charger if that's your thing.

After a 20 mile ride on my bike with it holding my phone, I'm even more sure that this is the best phone holder... No question. The other one I had used strong rubber bands to hold the phone.

I took the chance and bought it and have been thrilled that I did. The clamp is solid metal with a metal bolt to tighten. It is the pretty much same clamp that RAM uses but for 1/3 the price for the entire holder. The locking mechanism is sturdy and does not let loose. The phone is easily put in the holder and taken out with one hand.. I have probably put 1K on the bike with the phone in this holder and it has not moved even on the rougher back roads.

I mounted this to my honda grom and after one ride, the camera on my iPhone 12 pro was toast. It wouldn’t focus and could only take blurry photos. After some research, apparently this is extremely common with any phone that has stabilization built into the camera. I saw dozens of reports stating the vibration will ruin the camera. Apparently there are some mounts that will buffer the vibration, but now that I had my phone fixed I won’t be taking that chance again. This is probably fine for a bicycle though."

I found plenty but many used stretch bands on the phone itself that didn't seem sturdy. The roads around me are uneven, have gravel, and other obstacles so can be a workout.

I read several reviews on Amazon that mentioned problems with this product. I did not encounter any of those problems. In reference to the ball on the stem being so large that it made it impossible to thread the nut on the base, untrue. It did require finesse, but with patience and a steady hand, I was able to thread and then tighten the nut. In reference to an iPhone 11 (covered with an Otter Box) unable to fit in the carrier, again untrue. It fits. In reference to the red “lock” button being immovable, also untrue. I was able to move the lever with minor effort. And it did lock the phone in place. The one complaint that I cannot confirm or deny is whether the stem/stalk breaks on bumpy roads. I have only taken it for one ride, and it was relatively smooth roadway. All parts of the phone holder (including the stem/stalk) remained tight.

It really hangs onto your phone and the lock feature is perfect for bumpy terrain or if you accidentally hit a pothole on the road.

It's under 20 bucks so it's an immediate turn on in my eyes because you get what you pay for  Well I decided to give it a shot on a spare bike we have to test  2006 Suzuki boulevard C50T.  This thing is strong ! The Phoenix we used is the Samsung s21 + . Honestly I prefer it over my x grip because it covers the back part of my phone. You know , WHERE THR CAMERA IS lol las thing I want is raid crap hit my camera  Good purchase for sure will lrob snag another 1 or 2 for the other bikes  I dont recommend this on sport bikes unless you use a stem mount version"

We mount them on the driver side at the bottom of the vertical bar of the roll cage. Doesn’t block any view for the driver and the half windshield protects it from dust. We’ve also mounted one on the handle in front of the passenger seat...rotates enough that the passenger or the driver can see the screen. Clamp stays put on the bars. Spring is plenty tight enough to keep phone secure. Ball is tight enough that the phone stays in whatever position you put it in even when off roading. Quick install and uninstall so it can be removed between rides and stored in the glove box.

We went on a group ride, and I used my phone as my map for the ride. It functioned above and beyond enduring both bumpy roads and trails as we rode. So, with two rides down I hope this phone mount will continue to as well as it has. Bonus, It also opened up a pocket in my jersey to hold other thing’s."

I play Pokemon GO while pushing my baby stroller through the park and this is very easy to clip on and off and it's sturdy enough that once you lock the right angle in that it doesn't shift the screen angle. Just make sure to be careful to take it back off when you're storing whatever it was clipped onto. My Wife forgot to take it off and threw the stroller back into the car and crushed it and messed up the mechanism that holds the phone in place but I loved it so much I instantly bought a 2nd one. Also works great for kids to watch their YouTube shows on so they're less fussy when running errands or shopping.

Even without locking the phone in place it appears to very securely hold my phone. I ride trails/ street/ gravel and the rough ride has not cause me a bit of concern with my phone in this holder. I haven't even locked it other then when I opened the box when I got it... Price was very good and the durability appears to be built in. A quality product I believe worth having on your bike.

The locking mechanism doesn't work when my phone is in it, but I don't care as it holds it securely even when not locked and quick removal is more important for me so I wouldn't lock it anyway.  The attachment to the handlebar is also quick and stable. Also quick and easy to remove to transfer to another bike or to avoid theft while parked."

Phone mounts into holder even quicker. At this point it's very secure. However the locking lever is even more secure and would take a stranger a bit of time to figure it out for unwanted removal.

It affixed to the handlebar easily and it holds my smart phone securely.

I'll say you get what you pay for, but this feels like it could've costed more and I would still have been happy with it."

I found it very easy to install, easy to lock into position, and able to hold my phone on rough rides. I also note that it is made of very sturdy thermoplastic, and had steel reinforcements in all the necessary places. The model I got is the ""Lamicall LB 50"". I would highly recommend it.

Took 30 seconds to install. It's rock solid and I can put in the phone with little effort. It holds it very well and feels super secure over bumps. I ordered two types - one with some stretchy rubber priced higher than this. I had a very low level of confidence in that. The price is almost low for a product built so well.

I was a little nervous thinking that it wouldn’t be durable but it is super sturdy. Even at 80mph. The lock button on back also makes it even more reliable because your phone does not move. I use it for Bluetoothing my music & gps. It’s super easy to install. Definitely a good buy.

"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Exact replacement intensity & color to the factory installed bulb. The driver side bulb was very easy to replace, but the passenger side was much more difficult, so I only replaced the one driver side bulb. Looking at them, you cannot see any difference in brightness or color even the bulbs were being advertised as brighter, blah, blah, blah. They are an exact replacement to the factory bulb that is 3-4 hrs old already! I wld have rated it higher, but I had higher expectations going in based on the marketing! So if you think you are buying a better bulb than your factory bulb, your really not at all & getting the identical intensity & brightness!!!"
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","I purchased these bulbs after one of my headlights burned out. These seem similar to the originals in brightness, maybe a little brighter. (I didn't want super-bright bulbs.) After watching a few videos, I was pretty confident that I could do this job myself. I wore rubber gloves to avoid getting oil from my hands on the glass. It took less than a minute and I was happy to do it myself. I will update this review if the bulb burns out quickly."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Shocked that after my original OEM headlight bulb lasted 5 years, yet this Sylvania H11 XtraVision bulb lasted just 7 months! The second bulb lasted 11.5 months! The warranty service is great and easy, but still, I'd rather have a bulb that lasts at least 2-3 years rather than having good customer support on one that burns out in 7 months.  This was for my Honda. These XtraVision bulbs did not seem noticeably brighter than the OEM bulbs. I've learned my lesson and I bought some Osram bulbs which are the OEM Honda bulbs for the next replacement, which will probably be in less than a year once the XtraVisions burn out again!  Update: The first warranty replacement bulb that they sent me lasted 1 year to the very day! This means 3 out of 4 of these bulbs didn't last more than a year! The 4th bulb is 7 months old and so far still working."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",there are ultra bright beams but i am not one wanting to blind other drivers. this pair of bulbs works great and puts out a nice forward path to drive at night and to give others notice you are there. if you can pull a cord from the old bulb and twist this new one into place you will find it is cheaper than going to the auto dealer and paying them many times the cost for the same bulbs they likely use. as for longevity i cant answer that quite yet as they have only been in the car for a short time. lets say i have hope that a brand name seller would want their bulbs trusted to last. we shall see
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","These are great. I can definitely see more on the road. I did want to mention, these are yellowish light. I’m knew these would fit my car but couldnt figure out the color of them. (I’m not very car savvy and told my husband I wanted to be self sufficient and look for my own lights this time.) I was original looking for the pure white lights, but these work great and aren’t as yellow as my original lights, so I am happy with it."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Purchased these on Amazon for convenience. I typically buy them from AutoZone but I was ordering other things and threw this in. I like how they packaged it with bubble wrap around it for extra protection! They work great.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Good deal here... so for the same price I got a brighter bulb than the basic. But... I was not happy the product package was open when received. I don’t know how these were handled. You’re not supposed to touch the bulb. Already had my bad bulb out before I noticed so I just put one of them in. Works fine. I’m guessing someone just bought the wrong bulb and sent them back. Here’s hoping the second bulb is okay when the time comes to use it.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","I'm sure these bulbs will work great in someone else's car, but not in mine. I filtered the results to find the bulbs for my 2011 Honda Civic EX and these bulbs were the first ones listed. However, I needed #9006, not #H11. The H11 bulb did not fit my car. Sylvania also makes the #9006, which does fit. Don't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, my Honda Manual did not specify the exact model number needed."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Excellent price and are bright. Had to buy second set because I did not wear gloves to install the first time and they went bad. Always wear gloves when installing.

"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","These are basically the exact same as stock bulbs, which is fine, definitely affordable. I usually put in the Ultra ones for $43 but this car is on it's last leg anyways. If your do a lot of night/dark morning driving like we do here in MN, spring for the Ultra set. It's dark when I go to work, and dark when I leave during the winter months."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","These bulbs were exactly what I needed. My previous bulbs were super dim and had never been replaced. I could barely see at night. Switched them out with these. It was super easy and now they light up the road much better. They are not the obnoxious lights like some people have, but they do a much better job than the ones that I previously had on my car."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","These lights worked perfectly. I was able to install both of them replacing my burnt out factory lights. These are the lo beams. You do not need any tools to change these lights. The dealer wants almost $400 to do what takes 5 minutes and a $21 pair of lights. Do it yourself. I cannot speak to the longevity of the bulbs as I just installed them, but know that they both work great."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I only used one to replace the original burnt out bulb (10 years old) and brightness and color matched original perfectly so didn't feel the need to replace the 2nd one to match. Just holding onto until needed.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",The light output was greatly improved in our Chevy van. The view down the road is also improved and the color temperature is whiter. The headlight cassettes had to be removed to install the high and low beam bulbs and this allowed for a thorough cleaning and inspection. It's a DIY job for those inclined.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Says it was compatible with my vehicle but is not… will try again. my bad, this was for the regular lights, not the high beams. The high beams are the other model, these are for the standard drive lights."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",These bulbs are normally priced at least $30 plus at auto parts stores. So I saved about $10. Shipping was quick and the product is very simple to use/ install. I was able to change my own lights without having to pay a mechanic. I Recommend this product to any one.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","It was the right size and everything, and cheaper than store price. I just don’t know how long it will last. I purchased the last bulb from auto zone, and it lasted a year. So I will update on the longevity of this bulb."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Hard to rate based on ease of installation because it completely depends on the model of your car. Hyundai Elantra is no fun to change the bulbs on but that is not the fault of the bulb. Brightness is good for the money. Longevity is also good considering that brighter halogen bulbs don't last as long. Overall an excellent value and definitely cheaper than buying from your local parts store.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Replaced my fog lights with these. I have a Jeep renegade. Just pop off the little cover in the wheel well for access. Easiest thing I've done on a car to be honest. Brighter than the bulbs they replaced, but only because they're brand new I reckon. I replaced one (the one that went out) and compared it with the older working one. Could have left it in because it's very very negligible... Either way direct fit, all is well."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Used to replace burnt out original bulb on 2015 Ford Fusion. Worked great. Difficult to install but not the fault of the manufacturer as Ford requires you to remove just about the whole front end to replace a bulb.

"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",About the quality and brightness they should be. You wont blind others but you'll have a solid clean vision excluding your headlamp interfering if your head lamp is tinted or has other issues.  Doesn't over do the brightness which means lifespan should be decent.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Provides good, clear light for our Transit Connect van. Not as easy to install as I would like; mostly because of the headlight design of the vehicle, but once I got the socket out, the bulb just popped in and worked."

"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Like everything about it. Just have to remember if your silicone ring stayed on in your light then you have to remove the silicone ring on the headlight otherwise it will not install.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Bought these a few months ago after one of my headlights failed. No complaints so far, but I didn't rate on longevity yet. I'll provide an update if and when I do."

"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Worked as advertised and easy to install!! Replaced both lights even though only 1 was no good!! Great price ... These 2 bulbs were cheaper than buying 1 at auto parts store!!!!!
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",This was the first headlight bulb replacement for my 7½ y.o. car and the bulb was the correct replacement part and seems to match the brightness of the remaining original bulb.

Actually, it took a total of 5 min to replace both headlights. I think it was much cheaper than having someone else do it. I wore a glove because some of the videos says if the oils from your hand touches the bulb it will will wear out faster. So far it had worked like a charm."

"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Got them for my husbands car but they were wrong size so we returned them. Nothing else was wrong with them.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",These bulbs are a bit more intense than other bulbs. I just put them in so I can't vouch for the longevity. The color is closer to white not the yellow of low-intensity bulbs but they are definitely not blue like some lights you see. These are dims and I decided to try them since I drive with dim headlights on the majority of the time. I was not disappointed. My next purchase will be the bright version and perhaps on step up in intensity.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",These made a huge difference in my wife's Honda replacing 6yr old factory bulbs. Light output was dramatically improved! For the price I think everyone would be impressed!
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Not a lot brighter than the old ones I took out, but pretty good and very inexpensive."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","The bulb in my Volvo C70 burned out. I called the local garage and they were taking appointments 3 weeks out, so I ordered the bulb from Amazon and received it the next day. I watched a video on how to install it and then did so. Im a 66 year old woman. If I can do it, anyone can."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","I hate replacing headlight bulbs, but I have to admit, these bulbs are much brighter than those I replaced. For me, these are my high beams. When necessary, I will replace my low beams with Xtravision."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Not a review on quality of lights, I wouldn’t know since they don’t fit. This is a review of whatever system Amazon uses to match parts.  Ordered for a 2013 Chrysler 200, since it was a ‘confirmed match’ for my car. The lights are still listed as a match for this car. THEY ARE NOT. What was needed was a 9012 bulb, completely different plug.  These were just outside of the return window, so I’m stuck with them. Went to local auto parts store and got the correct bulbs.  Confirm elsewhere Amazons ‘match’ before buying. To be fair, I’ve bought several auto parts for two cars over the years through Amazon and this is the first mismatch. The only reason this review is being left is because of the inability to return. The Sylvania website listed for customer service/tech support isn’t secure and can’t be accessed on an IPhone due to a high fraud alert, so I can’t even bring this issue to them... Get confirmation your suggested parts are actually correct!"
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I don't know why but I have bought these about three times in the last year. Let it be known I am not great with cars so I know that water getting into the headlights and fingers touching the bulb couple bring down the life.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","I was hesitant to purchase these bulbs as there are very mixed reviews for them; however, my angst has been eliminated. The price is right, they're easy to install (5min), and they're bright but not too bright. I cannot speak for longevity as I just have just installed them prior to writing this review, but for $20 I can afford to replace yearly."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Since I bought my 2013 Prius I have bought five twin packs of these bulbs to replace ones that burned out, and now need another! I've driven now for sixty years and I doubt if I replaced more than five headlights or bulbs before this. The price of light bulbs of all kinds, including these, and burn out rates appear to be a money making scam."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","I bought these after seeing that they were recommended for my 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport on an auto parts website. Amazon said they would not work with my car, but they do!"
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",The install difficulty was a function of the vehicle access not the bulbs. Replaced both lights as that is what is recommended. We will see how long they last compared to how long the original ones lasted. (vehicle 10 years old).
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Quick delivery Excellent replacement for original bulbs
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",These bulbs are terrific. Brilliant light from them. Price for the pair was great!
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Got this low beam light for my 2017 Honda CR-V. It was a snap to put in and works just as I had hoped. The brightness seems like the original Honda bulb but half the price. Honda wanted $40 to install this. So I am pleased
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Lights are very bright and I can see more of the road while driving.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Standard OEM quality.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Just perfect brightness with its easy installation. Very Pleased with this product and it's a highly recommended product.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I have a 2010 Volvo XC90 that had one bulb burn out so I replaced them both. Super easy to install and they're still functioning properly and illuminating the road as expected.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I am so glad that I did not think twice about getting these lights. My original factory light went out and I panicked. Of course taking it to the dealership would have easily cost a lot more than just buying them here. I had my husband to put them in and I was shocked at how much they looked like the factory lights. I am definitely pleased with this purchase. And will order them again whenever needed.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",What's to say? It's a headlight and it installed just as easily as any and worked when I put it in
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Very easy to install;, harder to remove the old bulb, but managed."

"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Perfect and cheaper than anywhere local
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I replaced the OME headlights in my Toyota Sienna 2012 with these Sylvania H11 bulbs. I was able to see a noticeable improvement in the distance the lights cover versus the original bulbs. I don't believe the brightness changed but these lights make seeing at night much easier.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Work good brighter then stock,"
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I found this 2 pack of headlight bulbs on Amazon after purchasing the wrong bulb for my car at Walmart. And the price for 2 was the same price as the single bulb…and the shipping was free AND I received it the very next day.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",So far so good
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","The hardest part to installing these is removing the old and putting on the new (which is not the part's fault so no star deduction). Otherwise, these work great!"
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Put these into my driving light on my Chevy Silverado LT and man what a difference in brightness. Now let’s see how long there gonna last
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","I purchased these to replace the fog light bulbs in my SUV, they work great and were a lot cheaper than going to any national chain auto parts or big box store."
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I've used these in the past and they work as intended. Definitely brighter than incandescent bulbs. The life could be longer but to get that longevity you will pay twice as much for the next step up.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Good quality, easy to install just what I expect from Sylvania products"
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",These two lites are a good deal.replace both at same time
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",I was impressed with the short delivery time and the value of a great product. It's a shame that the car maker's design makes it so labor intensive to install!
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",These were a perfect fit for my 2005 Volvo and price very competitive. The one I went to store to get were the wrong ones. This was so much easier
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",If you want a little extra night vision without blinding the other drivers these xtra vision H11 is what I like.Now I don' t absolutely have to use my fog lights at night now as before.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",They work good
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",They are exactly what I needed! The exact ones you would get at auto zone half the price. The only suggestion wear gloves when you change them out so the oil from your hands don't affects the bulbs.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)",Exactly as expected and on time.
"SYLVANIA - H11 XtraVision - 高性能卤素大灯泡,高光束,低光束和雾替换灯泡(含 2 个灯泡)(H11XV.BP2)","Fit perfectly for my Chevy Sonic. Be sure to read your manual and Google search before buying to make sure it fits your car correctly. Super easy to install and was delivered with care so the bulbs were in tact. Super great deal too compared to other auto stores such as O’Reilys, AutoZone and definitely cheaper than the dealership."
SafPow 42V 2A 电池充电器 3 爪通用替换件 适用于 36V 锂电池电源适配器,We needed a replacement charger for our hoverboard. I didn't save the paperwork and our hoverboards have nothing on it saying what style it is and the two we have are completely different brands. This charger works for both of them! It has the 3 prongs but the little rainbow curve at the bottom and the size is perfect. So this is the charger that works for all those hoverboards that have to have 3 prongs and the curve!

SafPow 42V 2A 电池充电器 3 爪通用替换件 适用于 36V 锂电池电源适配器,"I bought this charger to replace the original one for a Jetson hoverboard. Amazon specifically recommended this one when, after I did a search on the make and model of the board. After plugging the adpator in and hooking it up to the board, a green light came on -- indicating it was fully charged. However, the hoverboard was not charged by any means. I left it plugged in for 5 hours, but it didn't do anything. The hoverboard never did charge. I was able to return for a full refund, but was dissapointed with the hassle I had to go through."
